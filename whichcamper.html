                            Most people want a simple life just as long as they can provide for their family. But what if
                            you want something a little different. Say for instance, a camper?
                            Here we will go through which campers best fit your lifestyle.

                            Maybe a small camper is what you're looking for to get started.
                            I will start off my list with one of the smallest campers on the market.
                        </p>

                        <p><h6>The 2020 Jayco Eagle 355MBQS</h6></p>
                        <a href="#" class="image full2"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></a>
                        <a href="#" class="image full2"><img src="images/2020jaycoinside.png" alt="" /></a>
                        <p>
                            This camper will appeal to those who want something simple but
                            want it to be fancy at the same time. Th eexterior on this camper has an alum inum frame that is vacuum bond laminated
                            gel-coated fibreglass exterior walls. It has the strongest roof in the industry, which is the Magnum Truss Roof System and this comes with one piece
                            seamless Diflex II material.
                        <p>
                            It is equipped with the I-class cambered, structured steel I-beam frame. Lighting is provided by the JaySMART LED Lighting, LED exterior lighting
                            and High gloss, fibreglass front cap with built-in specialty LED lighting.
                            This camper is equipped with 2 propane bottles to keep you cooking for a long time. The se
                            bottles are 30 lb bottles.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Trying to get into any camper can cause problems for many people, but this camper is equipped with
                            a sturdy, antislip aluminum entrance. It is made in the USA and also has blue LED lights equipped so
                            it is easier to see where you're stepping. Getting on the roof will be easy because there is a ladder
                            attach. On the back of the camper you will find the very useful electric stabalizer jacks.
                        </p>

                            The interior has wonderful hardwood slide fascia and handcrafted and glazed doors
                            drawers and trim. The floor decking is made of 5/8 inch tongue and groove joined
                            plywood. The carpet will be hard to get stained because it is non other than the shaw residential
                            carpet pad with R2X stain guard. Sound dampening is provided through the carpet by again
