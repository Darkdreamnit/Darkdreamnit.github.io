                                                <p>
                                                    The Bella Terra of Gulf Shores RV Resort is only a few minutes away from the Intracoastal Waterway. There are more than 10 
                                                    marinas in the Gulf Shores area. I brought that up because the activities manager at Bella Terra Of Gulf Shores RV Resort 
                                                    will arrange discounts on charter fishing boats to ensure you return. There is also the option of driving 20 minutes southeast 
                                                    to get on board the Southern Rose cruise ship for daily dolphin watching and dining.

                                                <p>
                                                    There are nine championship-caliber golf courses in the Gulf Shores area and the Activities Director will gladly arrange discounts and tee-times for 
                                                    you. Also nothing will be stopping you from taking a break in the pool that always look well maintained.

                                                    If you are in the mood for shopping, then there is this place called the Wharf where there are 57 stores that 
                                                    offer a wide variety of merchandise and services, from the locally owned swimwear shop H2O to family favorite Build-ABear Workshop. 
                                                    If you want the feeling of being in Las Vegas, then just a short trip away from the Bella Terra Of Gulf Shores RV Resort is Biloxi, Mississippi - home 
                                                    to some of the biggest casinos in the south. You can have a tour of all the casinos arranged with the activities manager.
