                                                <p>
                                                    Most people want a simple life just as long as they can provide for their family. But what if you want something a little different. Say for instance, a Recreational vehicle?
                                                    Here we will go through which campers best fit your lifestyle. Maybe a small rv camper is what you're looking for to get started.
                                                    I will start off my list with one of the smallest campers on the market.

                                                    <h5>The 2020 Jayco Eagle 355MBQS</h5>

<p>
                                                    This camper will appeal to those who want something simple but want it to be fancy at the same time.
                                                    The exterior on this camper has an aluminum frame that is vacuum bond laminated gel-coated fiberglass exterior walls.
                                                    It has the strongest roof in the industry, which is the Magnum Truss Roof System and this comes with one piece seamless Diflex II material.
                                                    It is equipped with the I-class cambered, structured steel I-beam frame.

                                                    Trying to get into any rv camper can cause problems for many people, but this camper is equipped with a sturdy, anti-slip aluminum entrance.

                                                    Getting on the roof will be easy because there is a ladder attach. On the back of the camper you will find the very useful electric stabilizer jacks.

                                                    This Rv comes with an exterior storage tray and a power stabilizer jack.
                                                    On the outside also you will find a spare tire rack and carrier and also
                                                    an enclosed underbelly. The power stabilizer jack is accompanied by a power tongue jack which
                                                    makes hand cranking a thing of the past. This means that if you should ever be caught needing to use
                                                    any sort of jack, then this will make life way much easier.

                                                    to sleep 3. You would be pushing it if you try fitting a forth person. Maybe a pet could be forth and
                                                    that would be fine. The weight on this rv is not too much of a hassle for a capable vehicle. it

                                                  Not everyone loves being in a travel trailer that has too much space or even too small of a space. Some 
                                                  people just want to be comfortable while at the same time enjoying their trailer. This is where the 
                                                  2020 InTech RV Intech RV Sol Sol Horizon Base comes in.
                                                </p>

                                                <p><b>The Exterior</b></p>
                                                <p>
                                                The length of this camper comes in at exactly 19 feet. The exterior is great, with fiberglass sidewalls and fiberglass 
                                                roof. The front cap is also made with fiberglass and has a tempered glass windshield. One thing i am happy about every single type of vehicle 
                                                is that plain glass was ruled illegal in the manufacturing process which should have been done way sooner than it had been. Enough about that, there is 
                                                a rear entrance door for ease of access. </p>
                                                <p>
                                                You will find the spare under the frame which is a steel wheel and also two storage compartments under the bed. Who can forget about the rear bullet clearance 
                                                lights and the 2" receiver? Not me. We just talked about the rear entrance door that seems simple, the rv also comes with another entrance to the side 
                                                and that has a screen and a window. You can showoff on your friends with this small camper with ease. The fenders are powder coated black and that makes the rest of 
                                                the camper stand out. </p>

                                                <p>This camper comes in at 3375lbs and it is also equipped with front and rear stabilizer jacks. Getting into the camper is 
                                                    made easy with a simple pullout step.
                                                </p>

                                                   Interior on the 2020 Intech RV Sol Horizon is remarkable. The walls are all grey vinyl and the floor is woven vinyl. 
                                                   There are six windows and they all come equipped with screens(tinted glass). The Dinette window has front roll down shade 
                                                   and the walls are insulated as well as the ceiling. This means that heat will be trapped during the winter and inside will trap 
                                                   cold air during the summer.

                                                    Sometimes we might see something on a brochure saying BTU rating and might not know what this means. BTU stands for British Thermal UNIT, and 
                                                    when it is in regards to campers, it is referring to the amount of energy a furnace or A/C has. This camper is equipped with a 16,000 BTU LP Furnace 
                                                    and a 13,500 BTU Low Profile Roof Mounted A/C. I do not have to mention the fact that this camper is well equipped for anyone to be comfortable.

                                                 electric rack and pinion slide-out rooms. There is a stow-n-go bunk storage and pass through storage. The construction is made super sturdy by
                                                 incorporating an I-Beam Chassis.

                                                    On select models, you will find even find a second entrance. No camper would be complete without a gutter rail 
                                                    and this model comes equipped with one. A gutter rail is needed on every camper just like on every house. The gutter rails 
                                                    protect the sides of the camper from stains that would be caused by water sliding down the sides. The gutter rail directs the water to a confined area 
                                                    which can be a metal drop-off or pvc grade drop off.
