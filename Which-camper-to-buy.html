                                                <p>
                                                    Most people want a simple life just as long as they can provide for their family. But what if you want something a little different. Say for instance, a Recreational vehicle?
                                                    Here we will go through which campers best fit your lifestyle. Maybe a small rv camper is what you're looking for to get started.
                                                    I will start off my list with one of the smallest campers on the market.

                                                    <h5>The 2020 Jayco Eagle 355MBQS</h5>

                                                    The eexterior on this camper has an alum inum frame that is vacuum bond laminated gel-coated fibreglass exterior walls.

                                                    This Rv comes with an exterior storage tray and a power stabilizer jack.

                                                    to sleep 3. You would be pushing it if you try fitting a forth person. Maybe a pet could be forth and
                                                    that would be fine. The weight on this rv is not too much of a hassle for a capable vehicle. it
