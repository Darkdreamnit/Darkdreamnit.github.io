        <p>
            One thing we all need to think about when we go camping is whether or not we will have a cellular connection on the campground we choose. You need to know this in case there is any type of emergency. The Twin Hollows Canyon is a great campground to visit as it has above average cell coverage with Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Twin Hollows Canyon has a total of 5 sites and offers accommodations for up to 14 days. Be prepared to get your boots a bit dirty as the pad type here is all dirt and has an elevation of 5,118 ft / 1559 m. The twin hollows canyon can get very busy during the day time so be 
            prepared for delays that may interrupt your traverse.

        </p>

    is known to be a primitive location (no water or toilets) so be prepared to provide yourself with everything you need to get through the day or days you plan on staying here. There are a total of 5 spots for camping which 3 of those spots 
    are large enough to use two campers.
</p>
<p>
    Something to note about the Twin Hollows Campground in Utah is that it is free and all campsites here are on BLM land which is why there are no restrooms or water.

    You can enjoy dry and dispersed camping at this location or hike on the trail. Bring your furry friends too as they are more than welcome. The cellular service her is not horrible either as on the AT&T network, visitors report 
    at least 3out of 5 bars of reception.
</p>

<p>
    If at any time you need to dump, there is a Chevron in Mount Carmel that offers free dumping with the purchase of fuel.

        <li><h2>Watchman campground</h2></li>
        <p>Location: UT-9, Springdale, UT 84767</p>
        <img class="lazy" src="img/loadingimg.jpg" data-src="img/Zion/watchman.jpg" alt="camping with tent and campfire and kayaks">

        <p>
            Whenever you visit the Zion National Park, it's always a good idea to visit The Watchman Campground as it is located near the park's south entrance. It is just a very short walk away from the Zion Canyon Shuttle System, 
            the main visitor center, and close to the town of Springdale. You can mainly access most of the park's trail and the canyon by using the shuttle bus service from around March to November of each year. This campground is available all year round and you have the option of making reservations of up to 6 months before your stay. These 6 moths reservations have to be within March through to the Thanksgiving weekend in November. There is also a first come first serve basis from the latter part of November to February.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Watchman campground got its name from the rocky peak that rises above it and visitors can access the three trails from the facility. There are three trails that you can access and the first one is the watchman trail. This trail goes up the peak that is behind the campground; the Pa'rus Trail which is a biking and walking trail that is paved and runs along the side of the river; the Archeology Trail which offers visitors the ability to hike to an archeological site.

<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p>
    There are many different places to enjoy at the zion national park. My favorite is the twin hollows campground because it is free and very peaceful at night. Anyone who decides to camp there will have to do extra planning 
    before getting there. Make the zion national park your next getaway, you will not be disappointed.
