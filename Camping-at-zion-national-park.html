        <li><h2>Watchman campground</h2></li>
        <p>Location: UT-9, Springdale, UT 84767</p>
        <img class="lazy" src="img/loadingimg.jpg" data-src="img/Zion/watchman.jpg" alt="camping with tent and campfire and kayaks">

        <p>
            Whenever you visit the Zion National Park, it's always a good idea to visit The Watchman Campground as it is located near the park's south entrance. It is just a very short walk away from the Zion Canyon Shuttle System, 
            the main visitor center, and close to the town of Springdale. You can mainly access most of the park's trail and the canyon by using the shuttle bus service from around March to November of each year. This campground is available all year round and you have the option of making reservations of up to 6 months before your stay. These 6 moths reservations have to be within March through to the Thanksgiving weekend in November. There is also a first come first serve basis from the latter part of November to February.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Watchman campground got its name from the rocky peak that rises above it and visitors can access the three trails from the facility. There are three trails that you can access and the first one is the watchman trail. This trail goes up the peak that is behind the campground; the Pa'rus Trail which is a biking and walking trail that is paved and runs along the side of the river; the Archeology Trail which offers visitors the ability to hike to an archeological site.
