                  <b>Lyrics to the spaghetti song</b>

                  <br>
                  <br>
                  "On top of spaghetti<br>
                  <br>
                  All covered with cheese<br>
                  <br>
                  I lost my poor meatball<br>
                  <br>
                  When somebody sneezed.<br>
                  <br>
                  It rolled off the table<br>
                  <br>
                  And onto the floor<br>
                  <br>
                  And then my poor meatball<br>
                  <br>
                  Rolled out of the door.<br>
                  <br>
                  It rolled in the garden<br>
                  <br>
                  And under a bush<br>
                  <br>
                  And then my poor meatball<br>
                  <br>
                  Was nothing but mush.<br>
                  <br>
                  The mush was as tasty<br>
                  <br>
                  As tasty could be<br>
                  <br>
                  And early next summer<br>
                  <br>
                  It grew into a tree.<br>
                  <br>
                  The tree was all covered<br>
                  <br>
                  With beautiful moss<br>
                  <br>
                  It grew great big meatballs<br>
                  <br>
                  And tomato sauce.<br>
                  <br>
                  So if you eat spaghetti<br>
                  <br>
                  All covered with cheese<br>
                  <br>
                  Hold on to to your meatballs<br>
                  <br>
                  And don't ever sneeze."<br>

                  <b>Crazy Moose Song</b><br><br>


                  <br>There was a crazy moose (there was a <br><br>crazy moose) <br>
                  <br>Who liked to drink a lot of juice (who <br><br>liked to drink a lot of juice) <br>
                  <br>There was a crazy moose (there was a <br><br>crazy moose) <br>
                  <br>Who liked to drink a lot of juice (who <br><br>liked to drink a lot of juice)<br>

                  <br>Chorus<br>
                  <br>Singing way-oh, way oh (singing way-oh, <br><br>way-oh) <br>
                  <br>Way-up, way-up, way-up way-up (way-up,<br><br> way-up, way-up, way-up) <br>
<br>Way oh, way oh (way oh, way oh) <br>
<br>Way-up, way-up, way-up, way-up (way-<br><br>up, way-up, way-up way-up)<br>

<br>The moose's name was Fred.<br>
<br>He liked to drink his juice in bed.<br>

<br>He drank his juice with care,<br>
<br>But he spilled some in his hair.<br> 

<br>Now he's a sticky moose. <br>
<br>A moose covered in juice.<br>

<br>All his hair went stiff.<br>
<br>So he combed it in a quiff.<br>

<br>His friends began to laugh.<br>
<br>So he had to take a bath.<br>

<br>As the water went down,<br>
<br>Fred the moose began to drown.<br>
<br>Singing glug-glug-glug-glug<br>

<br>Now let's all count to five.<br>
<br>Fred the moose is back alive<br>

                                                Swallowed a ball of bright red yarn,<br>

                                                I had a dog and he had fleas.<br>
                                                <br>
                                                He had fleas all over his knees.<br>
                                                <br>
                                                And every time his tail went flop,<br>
                                                <br>
                                                The fleas on the bottom all jumped to the<br><br> top!<br>

                                            <br>My parents took me camping, they said it <br><br>would be fun<br>
                                            <br>But the skeeters and the blackflies they <br><br>kept me on the run<br>
                                            <br>A horsefly bit my shoulder a deerfly bit my<br><br> knee<br>
                                            <br>I jumped into the water but they’re still after<br><br> me<br>
                  
                                            <br>There’s bug bites on my ankles and all<br><br> around my ears<br>
                                            <br>The itchin’ and a-scratchin’ are bringing me <br><br>to tears<br>
                                            <br>I am slowly going crazy swatting bugs<br><br> away<br>

                                            <br>Down by the bay, where the watermelons<br><br> grow<br>
                                            <br>Back to my home -- I dare not go<br>
                                            <br>For if I do... my mother will say:<br>
                  
                                            <br>Did you ever see a bug playing the jug?<br>
                                            <br>Down by the bay…<br>
                  
                                            <br>Did you ever see a flea with a banjo on his<br><br> knee?<br>
                                            <br>Down by the bay<br>
                  
                                            <br>Some people use repellent while others<br><br> burn coils<br>
                                            <br>You can plant some citronella or try<br><br> essential oils<br>
                                            <br>But if the flies are bugging and you just<br><br> can’t get no rest<br>
                                            <br>The best advice that I can give is pack up,<br><br> and move West!<br>
