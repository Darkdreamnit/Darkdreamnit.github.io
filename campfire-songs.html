                        <p></p>
                        <p> We all love singing when we are out and about. But
                          what songs do campers sing around the camp fire? One
                          very special song comes to mind when a camp fire is
                          involved, that song is called "on top of spaghetti".
                        </p>
                        <p> But do you know the real words to the song? I have
                          heard so many different variations to this song that
                          i had to do some research to find the correct words.
                        </p>
                        <p></p>
                        <p> Below is the full, correct lyrics to the song. You
                          can copy and paste these lyrics in your email list
                          and share it with your friends. </p>

                          "On top of spaghetti<br>
                          <br>
                          All covered with cheese<br>
                          <br>
                          I lost my poor meatball<br>
                          <br>
                          When somebody sneezed.<br>
                          <br>
                          It rolled off the table<br>
                          <br>
                          And onto the floor<br>
                          <br>
                          And then my poor meatball<br>
                          <br>
                          Rolled out of the door.<br>
                          <br>
                          It rolled in the garden<br>
                          <br>
                          And under a bush<br>
                          <br>
                          And then my poor meatball<br>
                          <br>
                          Was nothing but mush.<br>
                          <br>
                          The mush was as tasty<br>
                          <br>
                          As tasty could be<br>
                          <br>
                          And early next summer<br>
                          <br>
                          It grew into a tree.<br>
                          <br>
                          The tree was all covered<br>
                          <br>
                          With beautiful moss<br>
                          <br>
                          It grew great big meatballs<br>
                          <br>
                          And tomato sauce.<br>
                          <br>
                          So if you eat spaghetti<br>
                          <br>
                          All covered with cheese<br>
                          <br>
                          Hold on to to your meatballs<br>
                          <br>
                          And don't ever sneeze."<br>

                          Way down south where bananas grow<br>
                          <br>
                          A flea stepped on a elephant's toe<br>
                          <br>
                          The elephant cried with tears in his eyes<br>

                          <br>
                          Way up north were there's ice and snow<br>
                          <br>
                          There was a penguin and his name was Joe<br>
                          <br>
                          He got tired of black and white<br>
                          <br>
                          So he wore pink slacks to the dance last night!<br>
                          <br>
                          A horse and a flea and three blind mice<br>
                          <br>
                          Sat on the curbstone shooting dice<br>
                          <br>
                          The horse, he slipped and fell on the flea<br>
                          <br>
                          Woops! said the flea, there's a horse on me!<br>
                          <br>
                          I bought a suit of combination underwear<br>
                          <br>
                          Guaranteed not to rip or tear<br>
                          <br>
                          I wore them six months and to my consternation<br>
                          <br>
                          I couldn't get the darned thing off, I'd lost the
                          combination!<br>
                          <br>
                          I love myself. I think I'm grand.<br>
                          <br>
                          When I go to movies, I hold my hand.<br>
                          <br>
                          I put my arm around my waist,<br>
                          <br>
                          And when I get fresh, I slap my face.<br>
                          <br>
                          I call myself on the telephone<br>
                          <br>
                          Just to hear my musical tone.<br>
                          <br>
                          I ask myself for a heavy date,<br>
                          <br>
                          And I pick myself up at half past eight.<br>
                          <br>
                          Fuzzy Wuzzy was a bear,<br>
                          <br>
                          And Fuzzy Wuzzy cut his hair.<br>
                          <br>
                          So, Fuzzy Wuzzy wasn't fuzzy.<br>
                          <br>
                          No, by Jove, he wasn't, was he?<br>
                          <br>
                          I take a swim in my swimming pool.<br>
                          <br>
                          I jump from the board 'cause that's the rule.<br>
                          <br>
                          I hit my head on cement and mortar.<br>
                          <br>
                          Forgot to look - there was no water.<br>
                          <br>
                          That one-eared cat who used to sit<br>
                          <br>
                          Watching Grandma rock and knit<br>
                          <br>
                          Swallowed a ball of bright red yarn,<br>
                          <br>
                          And out came kittens with red sweaters on.<br>
                          <br>
                          I had a dog and he had fleas.<br>
                          <br>
                          He had fleas all over his knees.<br>
                          <br>
                          And every time his tail went flop,<br>
                          <br>
                          The fleas on the bottom all jumped to the top!<br>
                          <br>
                          Eli, Eli, he sells socks.<br>
                          <br>
                          A dollar a pair and a nickel a box.<br>
                          <br>
                          The longer you wear 'em, the stronger they get,<br>
                          <br>
                          You put 'em in the water and they don't get wet!<br>

                          bee.<br>
                          <br>
                          Four by four â€“ The hippopotamus got stuck in the

                          <br>There might be flies on some of you guys<br>
                          <br>But there ain’t no flies on us<br>

                          <br>My parents took me camping, they said it would be fun<br>
                          <br>But the skeeters and the blackflies they kept me on the run<br>
                          <br>A horsefly bit my shoulder a deerfly bit my knee<br>
                          <br>I jumped into the water but they’re still after me<br>

                          <br>There’s bug bites on my ankles and all around my ears<br>
                          <br>The itchin’ and a-scratchin’ are bringing me to tears<br>
                          <br>I am slowly going crazy swatting bugs away<br>
                          <br>Did you ever see a fly in a polka dot tie down by the bay<br>

                          <br>Down by the bay, where the watermelons grow<br>
                          <br>Back to my home -- I dare not go<br>
                          <br>For if I do... my mother will say:<br>

                          <br>Did you ever see a bug playing the jug?<br>
                          <br>Down by the bay…<br>

                          <br>Did you ever see a flea with a banjo on his knee?<br>
                          <br>Down by the bay<br>

                          <br>Some people use repellent while others burn coils<br>
                          <br>You can plant some citronella or try essential oils<br>
                          <br>But if the flies are bugging and you just can’t get no rest<br>
                          <br>The best advice that I can give is pack up, and move West!<br>
