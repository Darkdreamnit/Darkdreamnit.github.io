                                                    Owning a Class A Rv can be a dream come true. But what are the drawbacks to owning one of these vehicles? Below i will list some of the drawbacks.
                                                </p>
                                                <h3>High Depreciation compared to other vehicles</h3>
                                                <p>
                                                    When purchasing one of these vehicles, you have to think about the long run. These  Class A Rv's are very expensive and because of their size, fuel costs will be more than a Class C. After owning 
                                                    one for some time you will start to notice that your Class A is loosing its value by the year. On average, a Class A Rv will lose roughly  15% of its value each year.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    For example, if you purchase a Class A Rv for $300,000 and after owning it for 10 years you decide to sell it because you want to put the money towards another 
                                                    Class A that was manufactured in a more recent year, you will be lucky if you make back $150,000. This is more than half the value lost in just 10 years.
                                                </p>
                                                <h3>High Repair Costs</h3>
                                                <img src="img/ClassA/rv-repair.JPG" alt="Rv repair">
                                                <p>
                                                    Class A Rvs are very expensive to repair. They  are made with high-grade materials and are very bulky so when you need to get them repaired it will cost you more than Class C Rvs. Class A Rvs also have larger engines,
                                                     which means higher repair costs as well. Not everyone knows how to work on these types of vehicles which means you will most likely have to pay for high-priced repair services. 
                                                </p>
                                                <h3>Not meant for boondocking</h3>
                                                <p>
                                                    These rvs are large and hard to maneuver on bumpy roads.  Class A Rvs are also more likely to tip over since they are very heavy.  Class A Rvs are made for highway use and not off-road. Class C Rvs, on the other hand, can maneuver over uneven 
                                                    roads with ease and are lighter. This means that if you plan on going boondocking, a Class C Rv would be better at maneuvering the roads leading to the boondocking location.
                                                </p>
                                                <h2>How much do Class A Rvs weigh?</h2>
                                                <p>
                                                    A Class A Rv is a very large vehicle. On average, they  weigh around 25,000 pounds or 11.3 tons. This is because Class A Rvs always come with the largest engine
                                                     than the other classes of rvs. Adding engine size and all the creature comfort of home into the vehicle, there's no wonder why these vehicles weigh so much.
                                                     A Class A Rv will never have an engine smaller than 654 cubic inches when fully built; this translates into almost 9 liters of engine power and roughly 500 hp.
                                                </p>
                                                <h2>Diesel Vs. Gasoline engine</h2>
                                                <img src="img/ClassA/gasoline-diesel-engine.JPG" alt="Gasoline vs diesel engine">
                                                <p>
                                                    When you decide to buy a Class A Rv, the type of fuel will always be important in helping you make the final decision.
                                                     For every 6.5-7.5 miles that a gas powered engine travels on 1 gallon of gas, a diesel engine will travel around 10 miles on 1 gallon of diesel.
                                                </p>
                                                <h3>Diesel Engines</h3>
                                                <p>
                                                    Diesel engines offer a better fuel mileage over gas engines. Class A Rvs with diesel engines will offer between 8 to 10 miles per gallon. 
                                                    The running cost on Class A Rvs with diesel engines, however, is higher than Class A Rvs with gasoline engine but the savings in the  long run is worth it. 
                                                    You can expect that Class A's that have diesel engine will make life  a bit easier for you on the road. Class A Rvs with diesel engines are usually considered 
                                                    as more powerful and fuel efficient, but it also has its downside; diesel engines cost a lot to maintain because they have to use some of the most expensive parts
                                                     in their engine. Class A Rvs equipped with diesel engines will need servicing every 10,000 miles on average while a Class A Rv with a gasoline engine will  only need
                                                      servicing every 40,000 miles on average. Class A Rvs with diesel engines will cost you around $1,300 for some basic work like oil change and transmission 
                                                    fluid replacement while Class A Rvs with gasoline engine will only costs around $200. Class A Rvs with diesel engines has a life span of about 600,000 miles.
                                                </p>
                                                <h3>Gasoline Engines</h3>
                                                <p>
                                                    Class A Rvs equipped with good quality gasoline engines cost less to maintain and are also a lot cheaper when you buy it than Class A Rv's 
                                                    equipped with diesel engines. A gas engine wil be easier to maintain  than a diesel engine, it will not need replacing as often. Class A Rvs with 
                                                    gasoline engines are less noxious, smelly, noisy when they run than Class A Rvs with diesel engines so if you are looking for something that you can
                                                     use inside city limits then a Gas Engine is the way to go. Gasoline engine can be  Class A Rv used for about 300,000 miles before overhauling the engine.
                                                     Class A Rvs with gasoline engines have no major issues with exhaust or emissions that Class A Rvs with diesel engines experience. 
                                                </p>

<b>Class C Rvs offer features such as:</b>
<h2>How many mpg do Class C rvs get?</h2>
<p>
    These rvs get around  12 mpg on the highway and around 8.5 in town. This might not seem like much compared to cars. 
    But you have to remember that Class A rvs have far more power and luxuries than most cars. They also weigh a lot more. Weight is the main  reason for the Class A rvs low mpg.
</p>
<h2>Class A Rv Insurance</h2>
<p>
    Insurance for a Class A Rv will be more  expensive than Class B's simply by the number of things that could go wrong. Class A Rvs typically have higher value and will also require a 
    little bit more coverage since they are usually used as a residents for many people. The insurance cost per month for a Class A Rv will usually start around  $350.
</p>

<h6 class="conclusion">Conclusion</h6>

<p>
    Class A Rvs are more than worth it if you have a large family. They offer so many amenities like  a dinette, a bunk bedroom and even an extra bed that makes them ideal for families. Class B rvs may be cheaper to maintain but Class A Rvs offer more space.
</p>
<p>
    If you want better gas mileage then Class B rvs are the way to go but Class A rvs can't be beat if you have a bunch of people who need beds or somewhere to sit down inside for a chat. They won't only be sitting down for a chat while they are in a Class A Rv, they will be sitting in one of the most luxurious vehicles on the planet.
