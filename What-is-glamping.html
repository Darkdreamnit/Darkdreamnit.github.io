                                                <p>Glamping is a modern camping term that means to camp in a luxurious way. This type of camping is getting very popular and is drawing a lot of people to the concept. 
                                                    If you have a glamping site with a few amenities, it still almost always beat camping in a sleeping bag on the cold ground. 
If you are planning a family camping weekend and need to do it in luxury, then maybe it’s time for a glamping trip. </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    Glamping offers many ways of enjoying your time. These ways of glamping include glamping in 
                                                    tree houses, safari tents, yurts, teepees, or any place with creature comforts. This has become one of my favorite types of camping as it 
                                                    has made packing up less stressful after a vacation. Below is a list of the different types of glamping.
                                                </p>

                                                        This type of glamping appeals to kids and the kid at heart. These are usually modern treehouses with all the bells and whistles to keep you happy. A treehouse camp is a perfect getaway for the whole family. Just like when we were all kids and loved having tree houses, these types of getaways will appeal to all who want to remember their younger days.

This type of glamping gets rid of the need to pack a tent or any type of mattress to sleep on. Amenities are plenty, electricity, water, and many other things to make you as comfortable as when you were at home.

Some amenities in certain deluxe cabins can include other amenities such as bed linens, kitchenettes, and more. Be prepared to pay more to stay at one of the cabins as they are built with luxury in mind.

                                                <h2>Why choose Glamping or Camping</h2>

                                                <p>
                                                    Both types of experiencing the outdoors have their pros and cons. If you are the type of person who wants to take on nature without all the luxuries of a traditional home, then camping is for you. With traditional camping, you can pack light and spend a couple of nights in nature then pack up in a short amount of time and head home.
                                                </p>

                                                    When it comes to camping in luxury, the option of glamping will always be mentioned. If you are the type of individual who needs modern amenities while camping then glamping will the best choice. However, packing up after a 
                                                    glamping trip will be more tedious than the traditional camping trip.

                                                <h2>What is a glamping trip?</h2>
 <p>For many in Europe, a glamping trip is a vacation in a fully furnished bed-and-breakfast. Many glampers take to the outdoors. They enjoy their holidays in nature, surrounded by the spectacular scenery found in the U.S. and Europe.

In England, glamping is just a fancy term, and many English people use it as shorthand to talk about all sorts of places. More glamping trips happening per in the Us than anywhere else on the planet. That's because the U.S. is a huge market for all types of camping.

<h2>What is glamping tents?</h2>

<p>Glamping is camping in a tent designed to be a more personal residence, especially for an individual seeking a more nomadic lifestyle, with fewer ties and obligations. 
This type of tenting usually combines features from both the tent and the camper — a design that creates a unique experience. There are many different types, but each has several advantages for
 those seeking the more relaxing and enjoyable atmosphere that glamping provides. Most of these tents are modular, which can make the most of your space, and give you the freedom to decorate to your preferences.

<p>
The way we travel has actually changed. We no longer desire a generic, one rv fits all type of vacation. We intend to always want to submerge ourselves in the surrounding culture, and also we now would rather experience nature rather than see it on our many different types of screens. A combination of camping and glamour, glamping is a great way to experience the most awe-inspiring locations around the globe.</p>

                                                    For your and my convenience, glamping tents do have a loo. This means we do not have to go running across the field to get to a toilet.

                                                <h3>So what exactly is included in glamping?</h3>
                                                <p>
                                                    Individuals typically describe glamping as 'classy outdoor camping' as well as 'comfy camping'. Because of its fast growth in popularity, 
                                                    glamping covers a substantial variety of lodging alternatives consisting of yurts, Shepheard huts, treehouses, teepees and many more.

                                                <b>Conclusion</b>

                                                <p>
                                                     Glamping is the luxury of not needing to give up our everyday conveniences. It allows you to enjoy peace of mind and to enjoy nature at its best. Glamping is very popular nowadays and it would be a shame to not experience one of the many types offered. I 
                                                    have experienced Teepee glamping and the Safari Tents and would like to experience the others soon. The great outdoors is waiting for you, go enjoy it.
                                                </p>
