                                                <p>
                                                    Whenever you decide to go camping at the Grand Canyon. It would be great to know that there are two types of camping that are permitted at the Grand Canyon. You can choose to camp in the good campgrounds where you can park your rv or camper. Or, you might opt for the backpacking or dispersed camping options. The backpacking or dispersed camping is located just outside the developed camping areas and requires a Backcountry Permit. You can find information on the Backcountry Permit <a href="https://www.grandcanyon.net/backcountry"><b>here.</b></a> This permit carries a cost of $10 per permit and an additional fee of $8 per night per person. 


</p>     

<h2>Why is the Grand canyon separated in North and South Rim</h2>


A 277 mile long (446 km) canyon separates the park into South and North Rims. 
The Grand Canyon of the Colorado River is a mile-deep, (1.6 km) and creates a barrier
 that bisects the park. Even though the average distance across the canyon is only 10 miles/ 16 km,
  be aware that it is a five-hour drive of 215 miles/ 346 km between the park's South Rim Village and the North Rim Village.

Scenery, climate and vegetation are noticably different between north and south rims because of
 differences in elevation. It is almost like having two parks in one and it takes time, planning
  and effort to be able to visit both sides of the Canyon in one trip.

    There is not much better ways for you to feel best 'on the edge' of the South Rim other than by getting yourself a camping spot in the 
    Desert View Grand Canyon Camping Area. The Desert View roadway offers a some of the best views known to man.

Behind this grand canyon camping site is the well-known Desert View watchtower that was built in 1932 by the world prominent designer known as Mary Jane Coulter.

You're in luck if you're checking out this campground in the summertime. Campers can discover different offerings of shade for its tent-only areas, in addition to water, toilets,
 a shop and basic facilities. No reservations can be made for this campground as the Desert View Campground is a first come, first serve campground.

        This is a walk up only campground, since we didn't want to be disappointed driving 4 hours we booked a site just outside GC. 
        We checked it out the next morning and found a great spot. Running water, flush toilets (altho one back up and flooded the mens room), 
        and walking distance to Desert View lookout. A (very expensive) store is close by. Using a National Parks senior pass and sites are half price
         (as they are at most national park campgrounds). Lots of stars, deer, elk and coyotes baying in the night.
The campgrounds are small (less than 60 sites) but provided some degree of privacy. Drive thru sites are also available for RV camping. It's located very 
close to the east entrance to the Grand Canyon so you avoid all the lines getting in.

  <li><h3>Indian Garden Grand Canyon (Backcountry)</h3></li>
    <img src="img/GrandCanyon/Indian_Garden_grand_canyon.JPG" alt="different views of the indian garden campground in the grand canyon backcountry">
    <p>When they hear about your experiences at Indian Garden Camping Site, your camping buddies will be put to shame. To get there, you need to trek about two-thirds (2/3) of the way into the Grand Canyon. You have to make this trek with all your equipment on hand. The canyon views make the journey rewarding-- the white, rose-colored, and rust-colored rock layers show evidence of millions of years of the earth's history. This produce the best background for your camping site.</p>
<p>
A seasonal creek goes through the camping site, and lush rich grass, willows and cottonwood trees line the banks. Drawn in by the creek, the Native Americans also lived here for countless years prior to backpackers and hikers that found this unique location. Found simply off the Intense Angel Path, mule trains and hikers now stop at the Indian Garden campground for water and shade breaks. In the evening, the foot traffic lowers by a lot, and you're left with a completely clear sky of stars in among the most remote locations worldwide.</p>
<p>
Every camping area has a shaded structure for everyone's pleasure, pack pole, picnic table, and storage cans for food.</p>

        This is a remarkable green island of haven in the desert! It’s also the junction for the 2.4 km (one-way) trail to a Plateau Point (where the water was not working a few days ago, it being early season.) It did not seem well marked as some have said but we were coming up and so weren't tempted to take the wrong turn. It would be pretty evident if you did as it goes north at a pretty consistent elevation with minor ups and downs but your trail to the river trends gently downhill right away.
Even though it was early season, there was quite a queue for water but it was cold and delicious and we found it, after the tortuous devils corkscrew, a delightful oasis of rest and hydration before the even more demanding switchbacks above on the way to Grand Canyon village.
Two very large shade trees above the water source were diseased and needed to be cut down, I was sad to see.
How I wish to someday spend a night here!

<h2>Grand Canyon Entrance Fees</h2>
<p>
Just like numerous significant U.S. national parks, there is an entry fee. The existing expense is $35 for each vehicle on the South and North rims. The West Rim is unfortunately not a part of the National Parks Service. Different vharges will be applied if you decide to travel to the West area of the park.
</p>
<p>
There is a yearly Grand Canyon National Park pass that cost ($70). This pass is valid for for one year starting from the purchase date.
</p>

<h2>Backcountry Camping</h2>
<b>Open All Year</b>
<p>To camp in the park in an area other than an developed camping site on the rim you should get an authorization from the Backcountry Information Center. 
    This consists of Bright Angel Camping area at the Phantom Cattle Ranch. All camping sites in the Inner Canyon need a backcountry authorization permit. It is always best to apply for a permit before making your journey to the Backcountry. There are however a few lucky people who 
    will be able to purchase a permit upon arrival. But i would not take the chance of traveling here without being sure i will be able to enter. <b>There is a cost of $10 for each permit plus an extra charge of $8 per per person for each night.</b></p>
