                                                <h5>How to winterize rv: Step-by-step. </h5>

<b>This is a more in dept step-by-step guide you can follow.</b>

<h6>Winterize Instructions</h6>

<b>Things you need.</b>
<ul>
    <li>Antifreeze(Non-Toxic)</li>
    <li>Water heater by-pass kit</li>
    <li>Some sort of wand to clean the holding tanks</li>
    <li>Water pump converter kit</li>
    <li>Tools(Basic tools will do)</li>

</ul>

<b>You should first read your owner's manual that is specific to your RV.

</b>

<ol>
    <li>Disconnect the outside water source.</li>
    <li>Next you need to drain the water that is left in your system. If you read your owner's manual, you should know where your low-point drains are located. There should be one for the hot water lines, one for the 
        cold water lines and one for the fresh water tank. You will need to open the petcocks in order to drain as much water as possible from your pipes. Turn on all the faucets.
    </li>
    <li>There should be a drain on the outside of your water heater. Get out all the water from your rv through this drain.</li>
    <li>Bypass your water heater before you start adding anything to your rv. One thing you don't want happening is having any remnants of anti-freeze getting into your water heater. Some rvs carry their own bypass that 
    has already been installed. If your rv doesn’t come with one installed then you diy or have a professional install one for you.</li>
    <li>The next step is to add anti-freeze. This will ensure that your water lines don't get frozen while the rv is out in the winter cold. But before you do any of this, be sure to install some sort of water pump diverter kit or 
        disconnect the inlet side of your water pump and just sit it inside a large bucket or where you have anti-freeze. At this point you need to turn off all the faucets and drains that were turned on earlier then turn 
        your water pump. After the system is finally pressurized, make sure you go around to each faucet, turn them on hot till you start seeing antifreeze. Next, do the same thing for the cold water. Next you need to turn 
        off the water pump then open all faucets.

    </li>
    
</ol>

<h6>Winterize Your RV Water System by using Compressed Air: Ultimate Guide.</h6>
<b>What you'll need.</b>

<ul>
    <li>Blow out plug.</li>
    <li>RV antifreeze.</li>
    <li>Air compressor with adjustable pressure regulator</li>

</ul>

<b>Steps</b>

<p>
    <ol>
   <li>Drain and flush the black and grey water tanks</li>
    <li>Drain the water pump</li>
    <li>Drain the fresh water system</li>
    <li>Remove any inline water filters</li>
    <li>Drain the water heater. If you have a bypass valve, turn it on. </li>
    <li>Use your  using a blow out plug to connect your air source into the city water inlet.</li>
    <li>Turn on the air compressor: Use a maximum of 30PSI to 40PSI. I wouldn't go past 30PSI.</li>
    <li>Starting with the fixtures closest to your air source, Open each faucet and fixture and work your way out. </li>
    <li>Turn off the compressor</li>
    <li>Pour a small amount of antifreeze into each fixture (Toilets, shower drain, sink drain).</li>
    <li>Remove all low point drain plugs and hot water heater drain plug</li>
</ol>

                                                <h6>Exterior and simple winterizing guide</h6>

<p>The complete guide to winterizing your rv is what my neighbors always ask me to write about. 
    We all hate it when it comes time to winterize our rv. But it is always a skill needed when you 
   own a rv that undergo bad winter conditions. None of us want to have a bad start to the camping season because we 
   weren't prepared for winter blizzards.


</p>

<h6>First get rid of the water</h6>

<p> First of all you need to have a plan set up to just get straight to it when the time comes. When it's winter time, 
you do not want any water to be left in the pipes. Leaving even the smallest amount of water in your pipes will cause said pipes to burst after they reach freezing temperatures.
This in turn causes thousands of dollars in repair that could have been avoided. Water doesn't contract like some other liquids, instead, it expands. This means it will put a strain
on the pipes until they burst. So make sure there is no water left in the pipes when your camper is set up for winter.</p>

<p><h6>Do not to use regular anti-freeze</h6></p>
<img src="img/rvantifreeze.jfif" alt="antifreeze picture">

<p>Back in the day, it was the norm to mix the non-toxic type of anti-freeze with the water in the winter. Anti-freeze has a much lower freezing 
point than water. Many people used that method in order to not having to do the whole draining procedure. </p>
<p> when the camping season comes around again, they would get rid of the anti-freeze 
and be good to go again. But there is a downside to doing this, not 100 percent of the anti-freeze will be drained, 
leaving anti-freeze residue in your pipes. Only the non-toxic version of the anti-freeze is used but 
this does not mean it is good for you. There is a way to avoid having your pipes burst, which is to drain the whole 
pipes or leave just a small amount of water which is not enough to expand and burst.</p>

<p><h6>Get the exterior ready</h6></p>

<p>One of the best things you can do is to have a service station check the roof, sidewalls, seams, windows of 
    your rv. The objective is to reseal or re-caulk any holes or cracks which will stop any water from 
    getting in where you don't want it to. Nobody wants to be hit with a high repair cost when spring time comes around.</p>
    <p>I would advise in getting the rv manufacturer to suggest the brand and type of sealant to use in case your rv 
        needs it.
</p>

<p><h6>How to store your Rvs</h6></p>

<img src="img/camper-cover.jpg" alt="Camper cover">

<p>Doing everything necessary on the interior of your camper/rv will never be close to being enough 
    to getting the exterior ready. The best option is to invest in a cover that was specifically made for your 
    make and model. This cover will be responsible for protecting your camper against wind damage, bird poop 
    and tree sap. It will also be very protective against extended exposure of ultraviolet rays.
</p>
<p><h6>Protect your tires</h6></p>
<img src="img/tire-cover.jfif" ALT="TIRE COVER">
<p>This might seem like a no-brainer, but many people forget to take the protection of camper tires during the winter season.
    Tire protection is just as important as any other precautions you will take for the upcoming winter. One of the best things 
    you can do to protect your tires is to get tire covers.
</p>

<p>Keeping your tire in top shape is essential whether you're driving a camper or any other type of motor vehicle. Once 
    it's time to store your camper away, ensure that the right amount of air is in all tires by looking at the side of the tires. Use a tire pressure gauge to check. 
    Once that has been done then it's time to place all your tire covers over the tires. This will protect your tires from the 
    harsh winter season and also ultraviolet rays. </p>
    <p>Before taking your rv out for the spring or summer season, be sure to check the tire pressure of all tires and 
    put the necessary amount of air that might be missing. Tires lose pressure over time so it is always wise to check before using them 
    again. 
</p>

<p><h6>Thermal Curtains</h6></p>
<img src="img/thermancurtain.jpg" ALT="Thermal Curtain">
<p>One good option for a rv or a camper van is to purchase and install thermal curtains. these help to keep the temperature in the rv or camper at a nice and warm temperature which in turn helps to stop freezing temperatures 
    from being trapped inside.
 
     
</p>


<p><h6>Close your vents</h6></p>
<img src="img/rvvent.jfif" alt="Vents">
<p>We all sometimes take the simplest things for granted, we might overlook the simplest things that can cost us so mch money down the line. This is why we need 
    to make sure the little things are taken care of so we don't run into these types of problems.

</p>

<p>
        <h6>Protect your exhaust</h6>
        <img src="img/ventexausttip.jfif" alt="exhaust protector">
</p>
<p>
    One pesky thing that will happen to your camper/rv is if you leave your exhaust pipes open, rodents might take up residents. So i have found out that most 
    rv/camper tips are three inches in diameter so i have used pvc caps to cover them once winter roll in. this will ensure that said rodents will be choosing 
    somewhere else to make their home. Nobody wants to get ready for a trip only to find that the exhaust is plugged and needs repair. Pvc caps can be found 
    at any hardware store or online and they are super cheap. They cost between $.080 to $3 and it does not really matter which one you choose as long as it covers the exhaust tips perfectly.
</p>

<p>
        <h6>Get a furnace mesh</h6>
        <img src="img/ventfurnace.jfif" alt="furnace mesh">
</p>
<p>
   Another easy but important thing to overlook is the furnace. This is not really a winterizing chore, but if you have not done this as yet then doing it before the 
   winter roles in will be well worth it. Once you have this in place, you will prevent wasps, birds and other pest from taking residents in your rv furnace. If this is not taken care of then 
   there is no telling what will happen while your camper/rv is sitting during the winter.
</p>

<h6>Storing your rv battery</h6>

<p>


    One thing nobody wants after storing their rv over the winter season is to come back to a dead battery. The first thin g you need to do to care for your battery over the winter season is to 
    take the battery out of your recreational vehicle. This is because there is a good chance the battery will freeze. When storing the battery out of the rv, it you can still run the risk of having it frozen during 
    the winter season if not stored properly.
</p>

<p>
    The best type of surface to store your battery is on a piece of plywood and in a room with mild temperature. The temperature should not be too hot to heat the battery up or too cold to freeze it. Do not leave your battery 
    directly on the floor. One good thing to practice is charging the battery when it gets to around 75%. You can set a schedule to give it a charge on a schedule so that you do not forget.

</p>

</ul>

<h6>Rvs make money too - Rent Yours</h6>

<p>
    One way to get some extra income into the house is to rent out. You can do this easily by listing it on apps like Turo. This is an app where you can list any type of vehicle, including rvs, for rental. You get to 
    set your daily price and the mileage you'll allow. You also get to set the price of extra charge if the renter goes over the alloted mileage allowed. Another way to list Rvs for rent is on another website called 
    <a href="https://www.outdoorsy.com/list-your-rv">OUTDOORSY</a>.
