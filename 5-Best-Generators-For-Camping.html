                                                <p><h1><b>Generators for camping: Ultimate Guide.</b></h1></p>
                                                <img class="lazy" src="img/loadingimg.jpg" width="840" height="60" data-src="img/Generators/camping-generator.jpg" alt="camping generator">


                                                <p>
                                                    Whenever we go out camping, it is always a good idea to take a backup source of electricity. Here I will list 5 generators that i think everyone should consider. One Generator on the list is my favorite because I own one and have also upgraded the gas tank to be able to run it for longer hours.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    Used properly, the camping generator can provide power to our gadgets and entertainment during camping for items like: cookers, air conditioners (in tents), refrigerators along with many others. But more than that,
                                                     modern generators are now making camping easier and more quiet. You can purchase a generator that makes close to no sound and can be used without waking up your camping neighbors.
                                                </p>

                                                <h2>Choosing the right generator</h2>
                                                <p>
                                                    Before going out and purchasing a generator, you have to make a list of all the equipment and devices you plan on powering with the generator. 
                                                </p>
                                                <h2>How much power will you need?</h2>
                                                         <p>
                                                            Depending on what type of devices or electronics you plan on using, you will need a camping generator that can supply
                                                             a certain amount of power. For example, if you have small electronic devices like cellphones and iPods, a camping generator with 600 Watts or less should be sufficient.
                                                         </p>
                                                         <p>
                                                            If you want to run table saws or items like a microwave, you will need a camping generator with more wattage. There are camping 
                                                            generators that can have 6000 Watts of power or more to run any major appliances while camping.
                                                         </p>

                                                <p>
                                                    I think everyone will love the quiet generators on this list. 
                                                </p>

                                                    This generator isn't the most powerful on the list, but it deserves to be on this list because of the ease of using it and it's undeniable portability. It delivers 2200Watts which is almost enough power to run every item in your rv. It is equipped with the GXR120 engine that produces 20% more power than the previous version. It has been built to be more quiet and smooth. The bigger oil filter that is fitted to this generator allows for easier and cleaner oil changes. 
                                                </p>

                                                <p>
                                                    The highest quality magnets are used in this unit to produce very high-quality inverter power without having to make any sacrifices in the weight department. When it comes to reliability, Honda is one of those companies that ensures the best. With that being said, with any purchase of one of these generators, you will be given a warranty from top to bottom for 3 years.

                                                The Yamaha EF2000IS Generator is also one of my favorites because of the low dB rating. This generator only produces 51dB of noise under 1/4 load. It is not a large generator, but what 
                                                it lacks in size it makes up for in portability and power. The Yamaha EF2000IS Generator outputs 2000 watts and has a sound dampening case to further suppress noise output. This unit weighs 
                                                in at 44 pounds and will be able to run for 10.5 hours when placed under normal load on a full tank of gas. 
                                                 </p>

                                                 <p>
                                                     If at anytime you decide to upgrade, you can upgrade to the EF2000ISv2. However, there is one need feature with both these generators. You can use their parallel function which enables you to connect two 
                                                     generators for a total output of up to 30 amps. In order for this to work, you will need two generators and a Twin Tech Cable which is sold separately. This is one of the best portable generators at a reasonable 
                                                     price.

                                                  The PowerHorse 4000 is my favorite as I have personally owned one for over 3 years.  The photo on the left is of a brand new item and the one on the right is of my modified item with an upgraded fuel tank. The original fuel tank is a 3.9-gallon tank but I upgraded mine to an 8 Gallon. The original 3.9 Gallon tank can run the generator for 10 hours at a 50% load. I have never tried running it for more than 
                                                  14 Hours with my upgraded tank just yet but I know the 10 Hour mark is just about right on the original tank.

                                                     The major plus for this generator is the 8 120Volt outlets that it has along with 1 120V/240V 30 amp outlet. With that many outlets, you can have many different tools running at a time you might want to invest in some extension cords.

                                                             The Conventional generator is a much older type of generator that is made up of an alternator and a motor. To produce current, the motor has to run at a constant speed of around 
                                                             3600RPM. This however makes conventional generators more loud than inverter generators.

    <b>Conclusion</b>
</p>
<p>
Generators are perfect for taking on a camping trip. However, be sure to choose one that has a low dB rating as people might get irritated with you running a high dB rating one. Generators offer the luxury of keeping all electronics in your campsite fully charged and you can even use it to help the neighbor that forgot their generator.
