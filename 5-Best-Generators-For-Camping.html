                                                <p><h1><b>Generators for camping: Ultimate Guide.</b></h1></p>


                                                <p>
                                                    Whenever we go out camping, it is always a good idea to take a backup source of electricity. Here I will list 5 generators that i think everyone should consider. One Generator on the list is my favorite because I own one and have also upgraded the gas tank to be able to run it for longer hours.
                                                </p>

                                                <h2>Choosing the right generator</h2>
                                                <p>
                                                    Before going out and purchasing a generator, you have to make a list of all the equipment and devices you plan on powering with the generator. 
                                                </p>
<ol>
                                                    <li><h2>Westinghouse WGen7500</h2></li>
                                                   <img src="img/Wgen7500.jpg" alt="WGen7500 Generator" style="width:400px;height:400px;"></a>

                                                    <br>
                                                    <br>
                                                    
<p>
    The Westinghouse WGen7500 a portable gas-powered generator that is great for emergency backup energy around the campground. It comes equipped with a Push Button start and also a wireless remote. This allows you to have a quick start when needed.

    The equipped 420cc Westinghouse OHV 4-Cycle Engine is designed to give an easier start and provides great fuel-efficiency. This engine has cast Iron sleeves which helps to extend its life. You will not have to worry about adding oil before the due date as this engine has low oil consumption which helps prevent engine damage. </p>


    <p>
    To feed fuel to the 420cc engine, this generator is equipped with a 6.6-Gallon Fuel Tank and a Fuel Gauge so you know exactly when you will need to add fuel. With a full tank of fuel, you can run this generator for roughly 10 hours at a 50% load. It is equipped with an Automatic Voltage Regulator and a Circuit Breaker which is needed to offer protection against harmful voltage surges.
</p>

<p>
    One simple item that comes along with this generator is the flaps that protect the outlets from debris or moisture when they are not in use. And who could overlook the 10" solid wheel which makes this generator more than portable and not prone to punctures. There is also a single Fold-Down handle for easy storage.

                                                    This generator isn't the most powerful on the list, but it deserves to be on this list because of the ease of using it and it's undeniable portability. It delivers 2200Watts which is almost enough power to run every item in your rv. It is equipped with the GXR120 engine that produces 20% more power than the previous version. It has been built to be more quiet and smooth. The bigger oil filter that is fitted to this generator allows for easier and cleaner oil changes. 
                                                </p>

                                                <p>
                                                    The highest quality magnets are used in this unit to produce very high-quality inverter power without having to make any sacrifices in the weight department. When it comes to reliability, Honda is one of those companies that ensures the best. With that being said, with any purchase of one of these generators, you will be given a warranty from top to bottom for 3 years.

                                                The Yamaha EF2000IS Generator is also one of my favorites because of the low dB rating. This generator only produces 51dB of noise under 1/4 load. It is not a large generator, but what 
                                                it lacks in size it makes up for in portability and power. The Yamaha EF2000IS Generator outputs 2000 watts and has a sound dampening case to further suppress noise output. This unit weighs 
                                                in at 44 pounds and will be able to run for 10.5 hours when placed under normal load on a full tank of gas. 
                                                 </p>

                                                 <p>
                                                     If at anytime you decide to upgrade, you can upgrade to the EF2000ISv2. However, there is one need feature with both these generators. You can use their parallel function which enables you to connect two 
                                                     generators for a total output of up to 30 amps. In order for this to work, you will need two generators and a Twin Tech Cable which is sold separately. This is one of the best portable generators at a reasonable 
                                                     price.
                                                 </p>
                                                 <p>
                                                     Yamaha believes in their products so much so that a 2 year warranty is added to all products.

                                                  The PowerHorse 4000 is my favorite as I have personally owned one for over 3 years.  The photo on the left is of a brand new item and the one on the right is of my modified item with an upgraded fuel tank. The original fuel tank is a 3.9-gallon tank but I upgraded mine to an 8 Gallon. The original 3.9 Gallon tank can run the generator for 10 hours at a 50% load. I have never tried running it for more than 
                                                  14 Hours with my upgraded tank just yet but I know the 10 Hour mark is just about right on the original tank.

                                                     The major plus for this generator is the 8 120Volt outlets that it has along with 1 120V/240V 30 amp outlet. With that many outlets, you can have many different tools running at a time you might want to invest in some extension cords.

    <b>Conclusion</b>
</p>
<p>
Generators are perfect for taking on a camping trip. However, be sure to choose one that has a low dB rating as people might get irritated with you running a high dB rating one. Generators offer the luxury of keeping all electronics in your campsite fully charged and you can even use it to help the neighbor that forgot their generator.
