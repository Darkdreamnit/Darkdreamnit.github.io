                                                <p>
                                                    Rvs have been getting more and more luxurious over the past couple years. More and more rvs are being equipped with outdoor kitchens.  Why? To keep indoor activities outdoors, of course! 
                                                    The outdoor kitchen is a great addition to any RV because it can provide you with the pleasure of outdoor cooking and eating as well as prolonging outdoor recreation longer into the day.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    A basic outdoor kitchen will include an outdoor grill [can be a propane or charcoal] , outdoor sink, outdoor table, among Other things. In this article, i will be giving a full  description of how an outdoor kitchen should look and what it should have.
                                                </p>
                                                <h3>Outdoor Grill</h3>
                                                <img src="img/MustHaves/outdoor-grill.JPG" alt="outdoor grill for campers">
                                                <p>
                                                    The outdoor grill is an obvious must-have for the outdoor kitchen in any RV. It will save on your propane bill by cooking outside as well as enable you to be able to cook outdoors when there isn't room inside.
                                                     A grill is perfect for anyone who wants to  cook out back, but may have limited space and doesn't want to give up outdoor entertainment.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    Types of outdoor grills: If you are buying your outdoor grill for an outdoor kitchen in your RV, there are a few things that I highly recommend keeping into consideration before making any purchases. One is the size and price of the grill. The size of 
                                                    the grill should never be bothersome to store in your rv. Another thing to consider is the price. You do not have to purchase the most fancy or expensive grill to enjoy cooking outdoors. Keep it simple.
                                                </p>
                                                <h3>Kettle/Pots</h3>
                                                <img src="img/MustHaves/kettle-and-pots.JPG" alt="kettle and pots">
                                                <p>
                                                    These allow you to quickly prepare a meal or tea. Just like how you have them indoors, they will fit quite well outdoors.
                                                </p>
                                                <h3>Countertop Ice Maker</h3>
                                                <p>
                                                    A countertop ice maker will always be needed in your outdoor kitchen. I don't know about you, but I hate paying for ice at the campground. An outdoor kitchen can be a
                                                     lifesaver with this outdoor camper's best friend. Designed to fit on any countertop and draw less than 1A at 120 volts, this outdoor ice maker produces up to 26 lbs of ice. 
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    Having one of these will have family members cool in a minute without needing to run inside for ice.
                                                </p>
                                                <h3>Tools for measuring</h3>
                                                <img src="img/MustHaves/measuring-tools.JPG" alt="measuring tools">
                                                <p>
                                                    Just like in any regular kitchen, you need to have measuring tools. I know it's outdoor cooking, but you will still need to measure portions for your guests and look into certain recipes 
                                                    that require accuracy in estimating the amount of food needed for each person. Just because it is cooking outside, doesn't mean you will start using stick or leaves for cooking.
                                                </p>
                                                <h3>Cutting Board</h3>
                                                <img src="img/MustHaves/cutting-board.JPG" alt="cutting board">
                                                <p>
                                                    A cutting board is good to have anywhere you will be preparing food. You  can use it in the kitchen, outdoor kitchen or bar. It's all about keeping your food safe and sanitary at all times.
                                                </p>
                                                <h3>Cooking Utensils</h3>
                                                <img src="img/MustHaves/cooking-utensils.JPG" alt="cooking utensils for campers">
                                                <p>
                                                    You will want non-stick utensils for outdoor cooking so you don't scratch the surface of your grill
                                                     or outdoor set up. Spatulas are good to have as well for flipping grilled foods without destroying those big juicy burgers!
                                                </p>
