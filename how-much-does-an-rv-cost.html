                                        <h1>How Much Does an RV Cost: USED vs NEW</h1>

                                        <img src="img/RvCost/rv.JPG" alt="white rv with owners sitting outside" />
                                    </div>
                                   
                                    <p>New rvs usually cost anywhere between $30,000 and $500,000. Used rvs will cost a lot less depending on 
                                        the type of rv, the year it was manufactured and how many miles it has.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        RVs with popouts or a separate bedroom generally cost more than others because they provide additional space for sleeping. Luxury rvs cost more than other types. Some luxury models
                                         can cost over $500,000 depending on their features such as marble floors and Jacuzzi tubs that allow you to sit in your own personal hot tub while you drive down the road!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The age of the rv will determine how much it costs since an older rv may not have all of the same features as a brand new one would.
                                         Older rvs are still worth a lot if they're in excellent condition though and can be purchased knowing you will not have to perform a lot of repairs.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Rv prices differ depending on the class, size, and year when they were made.  A used rv for sale may cost more than a 
                                        newer model, but it might also include some upgrades that are hard to get in the newer models. You'll find rvs priced as high as $100,000 and as low as $5,000.
                                   
                                    </p>

                                    <h2>Different rv classes and their cost</h2>
                                    <p>
                                        <b>Class A rvs:</b> These average around $78,000 and offer a lot of luxury but not all the conveniences you would find in a more traditional living space. They're also on the larger side so they wouldn't
                                         be great for taking on long road trips as the extra weight would wear down your vehicle's engine faster. These types of rvs sometimes go over $400,000. With this class of rv you have basically everything you need to live 
                                         full time without ever having to leave your vehicle behind. 
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        <b>Class B rvs:</b> These rvs cost an average of $25,000 and provide a smaller amount of space. You'll need to sleep two people instead of four or six if you
                                         choose this class. However, it is cheaper to buy fees and gas for a class B than it is for others because they are less expensive.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        <b>Class C rvs:</b> These usually cost around $30,000. These rvs are the most common of all rvs and  also the most affordable. 
                                        They're very easy to drive and can be set up as a camper for two people or as a motorhome for six.
                                    </p>

                                    <h2>What long term cost comes with owning an rv?</h2>
                                    <p>
                                        Fuel will be your biggest expense. Depending on how much you drive, it can cost from $150 to $600 a month.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        In addition to fuel, your rv will need general maintenance and repairs like any other machine that runs on gas or electricity or that uses anything mechanical. Luckily for us, we don't have to use our own money for repair jobs if they happen out on the road! The company we bought our rv through offers unlimited roadside assistance. 
                                        This means anywhere in North America (or Mexico) and any time of the day or night, help is just a phone call away no matter what kind of problem happens.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Something else rvers need to consider when budgeting their finances is purchasing an extended warranty. Depending on the type of rv, an extended warranty can be costly.
                                    </p>

<h2>Is owning an rv cost effective?</h2>
<p>
    Rv owners are constantly debating whether or not an rv is cost effective. Can you afford to make the payments?
</p>
<p>
    Suppose you purchased a used 19 ft. Starcraft Motorhome with only 40,000 miles on it and paid $15,000 cash for it (retail value of this motorhome is about $35,000). 
    You plan to drive it 400 miles per day and you figure that your fuel will average about $2.50/gallon. That's 600 gallons a month at $2.50 per gallon equals about a grand each month just for gas! 
</p>

<p>
    That is just one cost you have to think about. There are other costs to think about such as rv insurance, daily upkeep, and other small things.
</p>
<h2>What to look for when purchasing an rv?</h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>Manufacturer</b></li>
    <p>
        Check the manufacturer of an rv very carefully, because some are better than others. (i.e. Starcraft is a good, cheap brand and Fleetwood is better quality but more expensive.)
    </p>
    <li><b>Age</b></li>
    <p>
        he age of an rv can tell you how well it has been taken care of by the owners before you purchased it. If an owner kept up with all the required maintenance on their rv that's a sign that it will be reliable for you to use as well. 
        Make sure to check this information out because if they didn't do routine checks and replace fluids then there may be problems down the road when you start using your rv regularly.
    </p>
    <li><b>Mileage</b></li>
    <p>
        A lower mileage rv could indicate that someone did not drive the rv much which could mean two things, one reason 
        could be they took good care of their rv, the other reason could be that it may not have been a good quality to begin with.
    </p>
    <li><b>Make</b></li>
    <p>
        When shopping for an rv you can usually find much more information on each individual brand than you can about the manufacturer as a whole. Doing your homework before choosing a rv is something everyone should do because some brands
         are known for being higher quality than others and if you know someone who already owns an rv or has used one in the past then ask them what they recommend.
    </p>
    <li><b>Type</b></li>
    <p>
        There are three general types of rvs - travel trailers, fifth wheels, and motorhomes (also referred to as class A, B & C). Travel trailers and fifth wheels are very popular among people just getting 
        into the outdoor scene. Class A rvs are for those who  want all the luxuries of home and are willing to pay substantially higher prices for them. 
    </p>
    <li><b>Length</b></li>
    <p>
        The length of an rv is measured from bumper to bumper. The longer a rv is, the more expensive it will be,
         so keep that in mind when you decide which type of rv you want to purchase. A longer rv will also mean that it will be a bit more difficult to maneuver than a small rv.
    </p>
    <li><b>Weight</b></li>
    <p>
        You must know how much your rv weighs before going on the road because each state enforces different laws as far as weight is concerned. If your rv is too heavy, then you may need special permits or pass certain tests before driving it on public roads.
         Even if you don't plan on taking your rv off-road past hiking trails and lightly traveled roads, it's best to make sure that it will be able to handle any trail conditions you may encounter on your trip.
    </p>
    <li><b>Safety</b></li>
    <p>
        You should never forget the most important aspect of a rv purchase, safety . Do not buy an unsafe rv for the sake of saving money or trying to save space. There have been many accidents involving rvs that were sold cheaply because they lacked basic
         safety features, such as airbags and seatbelts. A cheap rv is no bargain if you don't make sure it's safe enough to drive before taking it on the road.
    </p>
</ul>

<h6 class="conclusion">Conclusion</h6>
<p>
    If you're researching rvs online, take the time to read consumer reviews about each model of rv that have peaked your interests. Online forums give consumers a place to discuss their experiences with the models they own or rent frequently. Ask friends and family who have experience with rvs which brands they would recommend if you don't know where to start looking yourself.
     Many reputable dealerships will offer free test drives on many models they carry so that customers can feel what it's like driving them before making a purchase.
