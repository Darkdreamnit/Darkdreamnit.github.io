                                                <p>You should use the No. 4 AWG size for a 50 amp wire. This is the best size wire for 50 amp <a href="what-does-rv-stand-for.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rv</a> service. Whether you have a 30 amp, 40 amp or a 50 amp breaker, wire size is essential. Before you take on any type of wiring job, be sure to know the exact size wire you need.

<h2>What is gauge and AWG</h2> 
<p>
 Gauge is the measurement of a wire, particularly its size. AWG is the standard system used for this measurement. Wire gauge is determined from high to low with greater numbers suggesting a smaller sized wire size.
Accurate wire sizing is necessary for a breaker as it assists in figuring out just how much of a electrical current can pass through it safely and just how much resistance it will have.

    Please keep in mind that the details within this short blog post is just a simple look on the basic standards.
    For any concerns that you may have, seek advice from a electrical contractor that is licensed and certified, along with your regional electrical codes.

                                                The best option when figuring out what size wire to use at certain lengths is to consult a professional and get their input on the job you are about to partake. However, rule of thumb is to go up one size larger 
                                                than your job requirement if your wire is inside a conduit, ganged with other wires which inhibits heat dissipation, or your run exceeds 100 100 feet.

                                        Aluminum wires are ranked in a different way than copper wires are. For a 50 amp aluminum wire, you should use the No. 4 AWG. The smaller sized the number on the wire is,
                                         the larger the wire size. For instance No. 4 is larger in size than the No. 6.
                                         Aluminum wires are available in various types. Types RHW and THWN are the most typically utilized ones. No. 6 is only usefully good up to 40-amp.

                                        For copper wire, No. 8 or No. 6 THWN should be used. No. 6 copper wire can support approximately 55-amp at a temperature level of around 60 degree Celsius. 
                                        No. 6 wire is highly suggested. It's always best if a larger size wire is utilized..

                                    <p>
                                        Wires bring current constantly have fundamental impedance, or resistance to the existing current flow. 
                                        Voltage drop is specified as the quantity of voltage loss that happens through part or all of a circuit due to impedance.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        A typical example that is usually used to discuss voltage, existing and voltage drop is a garden hose pipe. Voltage is comparable to the water pressure provided to the hose pipe.

                                         And the fundamental resistance of the pipe is figured out by the type and size of the tube - similar to the type and size of an electrical wire identifies its resistance.

                                        Extreme voltage drop in a circuit can trigger flickering of lights or they will burn poorly, cause heating units to heat improperly, and motors will run hotter than 
                                        regular and stress out. This condition triggers the load in a way that they have to work with less voltage  pushing the current and work harder.

                                        Three percent of 115 volts is 3.5 volts if the circuit voltage is calculated at 115 volts. This indicates that voltage that is lost from the wires in a circuit shouldn't surpass 3.5 volts. 
                                        The outlet must still have 111.5 volts or 115 - 3.5 to be supplied at all times. Most appliances or devices need an extension cable to plug into
                                         some sort of outlet, some voltage drop will take place in the extension cable too. Some motors will definitely not run properly, and might even burn up, if the voltage at the motor is
                                          allowed to fall too low.

                                        <p>The best wire to use for 60 amps is to use a wire gauge of 4. There are however some cases where a 6 gauge wire will be sufficient.</p>

                                        <p>
                                            To use a maximum of 50 amps, you will need a wire gauge of 4. There are some electronic devices in our household that require only a maximum of 40 amps. However, there are some appliances that will need 50 amps, such as a washer or dryer. You can sometimes even use a wire size of 6 for 50 amps but the smaller the number on the gauge scale is the better. This is 
                                            because the lower the number on the gauge scale is, the thicker and more durable the wire is. This is especially true if you plan 
                                            on running the wire for more than 100 feet.

                                            To safely use a maximum of 40 amps, you will need a wire gauge of 8. This will allow you to safely use items in your house such as an electric cooktop.

                                            To use a maximum of 30 amps, you should use 10 gauge wire.

                                        <h3>What happens if you use the wrong wire size for 50 amp rv service?</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            <p>It is exceptionally harmful for anyone to try and use a wire that has a smaller sized gauge than required. The wire might melt and get too hot. 
                                                This might result in breaker or home appliance damage and be a high fire risk.</p>
<p>If you use a wire that has a bigger gauge than required, there will be close to zero percent chance of something going wrong. It can be a hassle, given that
     a bigger wire is normally much heavier and stiffer, however it will not cause any prospective dangers.</p>

                                            Another thing to remember is to pick the design of wire that will best fit your requirements. Some wires are made up of solid copper conductor while some other wires are stranded. 
                                            In setups utilizing some sort of metal conduit, the solid wire does not easily pull as quickly if the channel has a great deal of bends. However, solid wire is generally simpler to be 
                                            secured under screw terminals. these
                                             screw terminals can usually be found on basic switches and receptacles. 14, 12, or 10-gauge wire that is a great copper conductor and is usually the best choice for residential circuits.

                                                <ul>
                                                    <li>Disconnect your breaker panel. The supply to your breaker board will likely be 
                                                        split in something known as single phase. Single phase simply means that there is a single ground connection and 
                                                        a neutral connection along with two hot wires that serve your breaker.  
                                                    </li>
                                                    <li><b>Test your wires</b> - Pull the wires then link them all to your panel.  This is the outdoors receptacle. Then, install your  50 amp breaker (double-pole)
                                                         into the sub-service box. Please bear in mind the different colors of wires. This will help you in identifying the place and the placement of the wires.</li>
                                                         <li><b>Different colors</b>- Can you locate the red wire? You will need to attach it to a breaker terminal that is located on the outlet side. After attaching that, continue to the black wire. Try to find the other terminal, which lies in the outlet location of the breaker. 
                                                            The white wire needs to be attached to a neutral bus-bar. Next comes the green wire, this is the bare one and ought to be attached to the grounding block.</li>
                                                            <li><b>Final steps</b> - The half-round receiver is the green one. Prior to covering up your last connections, be sure to wire your receiver to the opposite of the green one (half-round receiver). The terminal screw is the white-colored-one. You are required to attach the the Y configuration to the red wire and to a single screw.
                                                                 On the opposite side of the breaker, attach the X configuration to the black wire. This is the very same for the other single screw on the breaker. Remember that Y and X are interchangeable.</li>
                                                                 <li><b>Test Test Test</b> - Turn the lever into the "on" position for the main breaker. Next, you need to switch on the double-pole breaker. This ought to work as your brand-new 50 amp outlet. To read your output, place your probes on the neutral receiver and one on the hot receiver. The reading you should get is 240 volts. 
                                                                    Be sure that you check more than once that the output is showing 240 volts, particularly after experimenting with the voltage meter. After testing it more than once, test it on your rv.</li>

                                                When handling electricity, say for instance, you're wiring an rv outlet, you need to take certain precautions into consideration. Here are a few precautions you need to take in order to stay safe and out of harms way.
                                            </p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Use electrical gloves, these types of gloves are needed when operating in low and high voltage applications to safeguard employees from burns, shocks, fires and certain types 
                                                    of explosions. These gloves are checked certified according to the ASTM F496 safety requirements.</li>
                                                <li>If you are dealing with any type of receptacle at your house then be sure to switch off the mains. It is likewise a great idea to install an indicator or sign on the
                                                     circuit box/service panel. This should stop people from mistakenly turning the main switch on.</li>
                                                <li>Avoid having any type of liquid close by as electricity and liquids do not play nice together.</li>
                                                <li>Use insulated tools while working with electricity.</li>
                                                <li>Never ever attempt fixing energized devices. Constantly inspect that it is de-energized initially by using a tester. When an electrical tester touches a hot or live wire, the light bulb inside the tester brightens revealing that an electric current is streaming
                                                     via the corresponding wire. Examine all the cables, the external metal covering of a service panel and also any type of various other hanging cables with an electric tester prior to starting your job.</li>
                                                <li>Do not use any steel or aluminium ladder if you are working with any kind of receptacle in your house or anywhere else. An electric current will certainly 
                                                    ground you and certainly go through your body. Instead, use of a bamboo, wood, or a fiberglass ladder.</li>

        If every RV with a 50-amp plug actually used anywhere near 50-amperes per leg of the 240 volt connection, then #4 wire would be recommended to minimize voltage drop. However, 
        the reality is that all but the largest all-electric motorhomes use far less than 50-amps. My motorhome is a fully-equipped 35-foot 
        long Winnebago Itasca with two rooftop air conditioners. The range is gas. The refrigerator can run on either gas or electricity. All of the overhead lighting is supplied by 
        12-volt LEDs. The water heater can run on either gas or electricity or both.

Even with every electric appliance in our coach running at full tilt, our motorhome does not use enough current to trip a 30-amp, two-pole, 240-volt breaker. While traveling through
 western Canada we found many campgrounds that had no electrical connections greater than 30-amps at 120 volts. Just turning off one of our rooftop air conditioners was enough enable 
 us to power everything else with such a connection.

Before investing in #4 four-conductor copper wire for a 60-foot run, which would be not only expensive, but cumbersome and heavy, I would suggest using an ammeter to measure how much 
current (amperage) the RV requires. We can run our motorhome just fine with sixty feet of #10/4 wire without a significant voltage drop. Just make sure that there is a 30-amp breaker 
to protect the wire. Otherwise, you’ll need to use #6/4 copper wire with a 50-amp breaker.
