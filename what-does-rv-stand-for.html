<p>
    You can have just about any size RV, the main thing that will hinder us from purchasing 
    the largest and best one. That is the cost, RVs can become very expensive really fast 
    depending on all the features it has and the size. The size will contribute to the high 
    cost as most manufactures set a certain MSRP on all their vehicles based on how many different people can sleep in them at any 
    time. It might be hard to believe, but there are rvs around the world that cost upwards 
    of $3 million dollars and then you have some costing as low as $1000 used. 
</p>

<p>
    The choice is yours as to which rv might fit you or your budget best. Since you are thinking about rv prices then that must mean you are probably going to be in the market for one soon.

                                                    This can be a much cheaper way to go as you can buy older vans at a very low cost.

                                                <H5>Motor Homes</H5>

                                                <p>
                                                    These types of recreational vehicles are some of the best as they are best fit for longer journeys. This is because they are the largest and ultimately
                                                     offer the most comfort. They usually come with their own means of power which comes from the engine, a bathroom, kitchen and bedroom. These however 
                                                     are the most expensive types of Rvs as some will cost over 1 million dollars.
                                                </p>


                                                <H5>Class A Motorhomes</H5>

                                                <p>
                                                    Class A Motorhomes the largest of all the types of motorhomes as mentioned above. These are the types of rvs that comes fully equipped as if it were a real home. I don not know of 
                                                    one person who wasn't amazed at how spacious and luxurious these motorhomes can get. These types of rvs can be anywhere between 26 feet and 45 feet and usually weigh between 13000 and 30000 pounds. 
                                                    With these types of motorhomes, you get options like bottom storage where you can store a boat or another vehicle, full kitchen and bathroom, awnings, and slide-outs. The bedrooms are even big enough to 
                                                    fit a queen or king-sized beds.

                                                
                                                </p>

                                                <h5>Class B Motorhomes</h5>

                                                <p>
                                                    These rvs weigh between 4000 to 9000 pounds and and are between 17 to 23 feet in size. They are often called camper vans and are mid-sized compared to class a and c rvs. To build these,the common types of vehicles 
                                                    used are the ford transit, mercedes sprinter and the ram promaster. Your only sacrifice in getting one of these compared to the class a would be space. But some of these class b vehicles comes with dining rooms, 
                                                    bathrooms and some even sleep six. One option to owning a class b vehicles is that some do have the four-wheel-drive and do have good gas mileage. They are also able to fit in more parking spots than a 
                                                    class a and are much easier to handle on the road.

                                                <h5>Class C Motorhomes</h5>

                                                <p>
                                                    The class c motorhome is usually built on the chassis of a van or a truck that was designed for a motorhome. They usually come with a overhang area just above the cab of the van or truck. This hangover is usually 
                                                    used for storage or a sleeping area. These types of rvs come with almost all the same amenities as the Class A but at a much cheaper price. You won't get better fuel economy as the Class B but you will definitely 
                                                    get better fuel economy than the Class A.

                                                    These are usually too large to fit in a regular garage and some will not even fit in your driveway. Before purchasing one of these, you need to think about where you will be storing it during the offs-seasons or 
                                                    just on a daily basis. These are great for adventures but you might want to purchase something a little bit larger if you plan on living full-time in a recreational vehicle.

                                                <h5>Travel Trailer</h5>

                                                <p> 
                                                    When you talk about a travel trailer, you are ultimately talking about the most popular type of rv. It comes in many different styles, types and sizes. 
                                                    This abundance of choices is perfect for every different type of preference that people may have. There is a travel trailer out there to fit almost anyone's needs. 

                                                    A travel trailer is essentially a compact home which you tow behind your vehicle. One thing you have to check before purchasing a travel trailer is that your personal 
                                                    vehicle cam tow the weight of the travel trailer without any problems. For this, most people choose trucks like Rams, Ford F150s or Chevy Silverados.
                                                    
                                                    Travel trailers come in many different sizes, they usually range in sizes from roughly 12 feet to 35 feet long. The simplest ones come in the 12-foot versions and offer enough comfort for one or two people. The 
                                                    35-foot versions will allow space for up to 10 people. A travel trailer comes in at a price of roughly between $10,000 to $18,000. Motorhome can go for up to a hundred times this price and make for a good start 
                                                    to someone who wants to get into rving.

                                                    A truck camper is just a step down from the larger Motor Home. They do not have their own means of power to move so they do have to 
                                                    be towed by another vehicle. Not all vehicles can tow a camper as they are on the large and heavy side as they do come with a bathroom, kitchen 
                                                    and bedroom. People use these for short journeys and camping trips that do not last too long.

                                                <h5>Fifth Wheel Travel Trailer</h5>

                                                <p>
                                                    Just like the Conventional travel trailer above, the Fifth Wheel Travel Trailer will have the same amenities. These are equipped with regular conveniences such as showering, sleeping, dining, cooking. There are also 
                                                    some luxury versions of Fifth Wheel Travel Trailers that have slide-outs which allows the rv walls to move outward up to three feet. You activate this outward movement by just the click of a button and this give you 
                                                    extra living area space. Getting your truck unhitched from the Fifth Wheel is very easy if you want to run any type of errand with only the truck. Just like other 
                                                    rvs that needs to be towed, you will have to make sure that the truck you decide to use for towing is able to handle the weight.

                                                </p>

                                                <H5>Pop-Up Camper</H5>

                                                <p>
                                                    These types of Rvs are some of the smallest. They are usually easy to tow and do not come with all the amenities of Motor Homes or regular 
                                                    Campers. These have been getting more popular in recent years as more and more people are getting interested in the camping hobby. 
                                                </p>

                                                <p><b>Below are a couple of vans people regularly modify into recreational vehicles</b></p>

                                                <p>The first one on the list is the Vw Van also known as the Type 2. </p>

                                                <img src="img/oldvan.jpg" alt="VW camper Van">


<p>This van has become an icon in so many different car scenes. They can be had for cheap if you look around or keep an eye open on the market. However, if you need one that is in great 
    condition then you might be paying a pretty penny. 
</p>


<p><b>The second one on the list is the same Vw Van but this time in great condition.</b></p>
                                                <img src="img/oldvan2.jpg" alt="VW van">

<p>This Vw van is the perfect example of how good one of these vans can become. Who would not want a perfectly restored vw van as a recreational vehicle. You have to understand though that these types of 
    recreational vehicles are on the small interior side. They are fun to own, but it would be wise to stay inside of one for a few minutes first. Sit in the back and pretend to use your laptop, stand in the 
    back and pretend to cook on a stove, lay down in a certain area of the vehicle and pretend to sleep. 
</p>

<p>You do all these things first to see if it would be comfortable to you for even a night. The aim of renovating one of these is to at least be able to sleep in it for a couple hours. 
    So try to follow the simple steps above to see how comfortable you would be in one of them.
</p>

<p>
    The next step to take is to try and get the chance to test drive one of these recreational vehicles. I am the type of person who loved driving small sports cars and suvs so getting into driving 
    recreational vehicles was kind of a hard change. It is hard when you are just starting out because the larger the recreational vehicle the more skill is needed to maneuver it. When driving one of these 
    vehicles, you have to remember that you are not in a regularly vehicle, almost everything you learned while driving a regular vehicle has to be tweaked a little bit.  
</p>

<ol class="whatdoesrvmean">
    <li class="whatdoesrvmean">You will have to learn to apply your brakes earlier in order to stop.</li>
    <li class="whatdoesrvmean">You will have to take corners more carefully as you will be maneuvering a larger vehicle.</li>
    <li class="whatdoesrvmean">You will have to use your mirrors way more and you will have to adjust them to fit your driving style.</li>
    <li class="whatdoesrvmean">Depending on the type or size of recreational vehicle, you have to know the type of roads that are legal for that size to drive on.</li>
    <li class="whatdoesrvmean">Backing up and parking can become a chore really quick.</li>
    <li class="whatdoesrvmean">You can up your brakes on certain high hills if you do not learn how to use them properly.</li>
    <li class="whatdoesrvmean">The height of your recreational vehicle might hinder you from taking certain highways.</li>

<h6>Some people convert cars into rvs</h6>

<h6>1. Honda Element</h6>

<img src="img/hondaelement.jpg" alt="Honda Element">
<img src="img/elementinside.webp" alt="HOnda element interior">

<p>
You will be surprised to know that you will see a couple people turning their cars/suvs into recreational vehicles. This idea of using the 
honda element comes from a website called <a href="https://www.doityourselfrv.com/suvs-crossover-campers/">doityourselfrv</a>. This can be a cheap 
way of getting into the rv scene if you happen to have an extra honda element laying around. It is not the most spacious car/suv available today 
but they are at a good price range right now to be considered. A 2010 Honda Element with a little over 100,000 Miles is listed at $10,990 at the time 
of writing this on KellyBlueBook. With that price point, i wouldn't overlook this vehicle.
</p>


<h6>2. Honda Crv</h6>

<img src="img/hondacrvout.jpg" alt="Honda CRV">
<img src="img/hondacrv.webp" alt="Honda CRV Interior">

<p>
Another suv on the list of cars that can be used as a recreational vehicle is the very reliable honda crv. The back seats in this suv can be 
easily removed so you can convert the rear into a sleeping quarter. There is enough space in the back for two people to enjoy a great nap 
while bugs chirp away int the night. This is also a great vehicle to consider for conversion.
</p>

<h6>What Do RVs Come With?</h6>

<p>
    <ul>
        <li>A good quality rv will come with its own bathroom with all the bells and whistles.</li>
        <li>Rvs that have the space will come with a complete kitchen. This will include a microwave, a 
            stove, and maybe a small fridge.
        </li>
        <li>Some Rvs come with a full entertainment package: television, satellite, surround sound system</li>
        <li>Rvs usually come with a bedroom, even tho some will be larger than others 
            depending on the price and size of the said rv.</li>
            <li>Luxurious Rvs will come equipped with a dining room.</li>
    </ul>
 </p>



 <h6>Benefits of living in an rv</h6>

 <p>
     One way benefit of living in an rv is that you can save money by boondocking(Dry Camping).  Boondocking is when you park at places like walmart or a cracker barrel for free instead of staying at acampground 
     or rv resort. This practice must be used with discretion as you will not be allowed to park for days on end at these businesses. 
 </p>


 <p>
     Just imagine feeling like you are always on vacation, this is what living in an rv feels like. You will have the option of deciding where to live at any given point without worrying about getting things packed or hiring 
     a mover. With some rvs, you will feel like you're just at home because they come equipped with all amenities like dining roms, living rooms, kitchen, bathrooms, sleeping area and plenty more to enjoy. 

     Just imagine being able to take your place of residents with you whenever there is the threat of any type of natural disaster in your area.
