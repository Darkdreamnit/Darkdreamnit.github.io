                                                     for people who love going on adventures, love camping or just love sleeping out in the wild. </b></i>

                                                    <h2>There are many different types of Rvs</h2>

<p>
    You can have just about any size RV, the main thing that will hinder us from purchasing 
    the largest and best one is the cost, RVs can become very expensive really fast 
    depending on all the features it has and the size. The size will contribute to the high 
    cost as most manufacturers set a certain MSRP on all their vehicles based on how many different people can sleep in them at any 
    time. It might be hard to believe, but there are rvs around the world that cost upwards 
    of $3 million dollars and then you have some costing as low as $1000 used. 
</p>

<p>
    The choice is yours as to which rv might fit you or your budget best. Since you are thinking about rv prices then that must mean you are probably going to be in the market for one soon.

                                                    This can be a much cheaper way to go as you can buy older vans at a very low cost.

                                                <H2>Motor Homes</H2>

                                                <p>
                                                    These types of recreational vehicles are some of the best as they are the best fit for longer journeys. This is because they are the largest and ultimately
                                                     offer the most comfort. They usually come with their own means of power which comes from the engine, a bathroom, kitchen, and bedroom. These however 
                                                     are the most expensive types of Rvs as some will cost over 1 million dollars.
                                                </p>


                                                <H2>Class A Motorhomes</H2>

                                                <p>
                                                    Class A Motorhomes the largest of all the types of motorhomes as mentioned above. These are the types of rvs that comes fully equipped as if it were a real home. I do not know of 
                                                    one person who wasn't amazed at how spacious and luxurious these motorhomes can get. These types of rvs can be anywhere between 26 feet and 45 feet and usually weigh between 13000 and 30000 pounds. 
                                                    With these types of motorhomes, you get options like bottom storage where you can store a boat or another vehicle, full kitchen and bathroom, awnings, and slide-outs. The bedrooms are even big enough to 
                                                    fit a queen or king-sized beds.

                                                
                                                </p>

                                                <h2>Class B Motorhomes</h2>

                                                <p>
                                                    These rvs weigh between 4000 to 9000 pounds and and are between 17 to 23 feet in size. They are often called camper vans and are mid-sized compared to class a and c rvs. To build these,the common types of vehicles 
                                                    used are the ford transit, Mercedes sprinter, and the ram Promaster. Your only sacrifice in getting one of these compared to the class a would be space. But some of these class b vehicles come with dining rooms, 
                                                    bathrooms, and some even sleep six. One option to owning a class b vehicles is that some do have the four-wheel-drive and do have good gas mileage. They are also able to fit in more parking spots than a class a and are much easier to handle on the road.
                                                </p>

                                                <h2>Class C Motorhomes</h2>

                                                <p>
                                                    The class c motorhome is usually built on the chassis of a van or a truck that was designed for a motorhome. They usually come with an overhang area just above the cab of the van or truck. This hangover is usually used for storage or a sleeping area. These types of rvs come with almost all the same amenities as the Class A but at a much cheaper price. You won't get better fuel economy as the Class B but you will definitely get better fuel economy than the Class A.

                                                    These are usually too large to fit in a regular garage and some will not even fit in your driveway. Before purchasing one of these, you need to think about where you will be storing it during the offs-seasons or just on a daily basis. These are great for adventures but you might want to purchase something a little bit larger if you plan on living full-time in a recreational vehicle.

                                                <h2>Travel Trailer</h2>

                                                <p> 
                                                    When you talk about a travel trailer, you are ultimately talking about the most popular type of rv. It comes in many different styles, types, and sizes. 
                                                    This abundance of choices is perfect for every different type of preference that people may have. There is a travel trailer out there to fit almost anyone's needs. 

                                                    A travel trailer is essentially a compact home that you tow behind your vehicle. One thing you have to check before purchasing a travel trailer is that your personal  vehicle can tow the weight of the travel trailer without any problems. For this, most people choose trucks like Rams, Ford F150s,or Chevy Silverados.
                                                    
                                                    Travel trailers come in many different sizes, they usually range in sizes from roughly 12 feet to 35 feet long. The simplest ones come in the 12-foot versions and offer enough comfort for one or two people. The 
                                                    35-foot versions will allow space for up to 10 people. A travel trailer comes in at a price of roughly $10,000 to $18,000. Motorhome can go for up to a hundred times this price and make for a good start to someone who wants to get into rving.

                                                    A truck camper is just a step down from the larger Motor Home. They do not have their own means of power to move so they do have to be towed by another vehicle. Not all vehicles can tow a camper as they are on the large and heavy side as they do come with a bathroom, kitchen, and bedroom. People use these for short journeys and camping trips that do not last too long.

                                                    Just like the Conventional travel trailer above, the Fifth Wheel Travel Trailer will have the same amenities. These are equipped with regular conveniences such as showering, sleeping, dining, cooking. There are also some luxury versions of Fifth Wheel Travel Trailers that have slide-outs which allows the rv walls to move outward up to three feet. You activate this outward movement by just the click of a button and this gives you extra living area space. Getting your truck unhitched from the Fifth Wheel is very easy if you want to run any type of errand with only the truck. Just like other rvs that needs to be towed, you will have to make sure that the truck you decide to use for towing is able to handle the weight.

                                                </p>

                                                <p>
                                                    These types of Rvs are some of the smallest. They are usually easy to tow and do not come with all the amenities of Motor Homes or regular 
                                                    Campers. These have been getting more popular in recent years as more and more people are getting interested in the camping hobby.

                                                <h2>Toy Hauler</h2>

                                                <p>
                                                    Toy haulers are most popular amongst people who are involved in motorsports. These types of rvs can accommodate golf carts, dirt bikes, snowmobiles, kayaks, Motorcycles and so much more. They come with a large storage/cargo area to haul any of these types of vehicles. They also come with heavy-duty doors which in turn doubles as a ramp in order to get vehicles in and out of the rv or just to load heavy gear. This type of rv is different from other rvs. This type falls in the sub-category of rvs as it is available in both towable and motorized versions but they mostly come as fifth wheels. A toy hauler is perfect for everyone who wants to have their grown-up toys with them wherever they want to go. Instead of riding say for instance a motorcycle to your friend's house 600 miles away, you can take your car with a toy hauler equipped with your motorcycle. 
                                                </p>

                                                <p>
                                                    These rvs are the perfect basecamp with its comfortable living area and spacious garage.

                                                <h2>Teardrop Campers / Teardrop Trailers</h2>

                                                <p>
                                                    It would be very hard to mistake this type of recreational vehicle for any other type of recreational vehicle. This is because it is actually shaped like a teardrop. This is usually a perfect fit for the weekend warriors who are comfortable with basic amenities. Just like class b rvs, the teardrop camper trailer is built with folding sinks, swivel toilets, convertible beds, and a lot more. With these in place, it makes the camper trailer more functional. Teardrop campers are not heavy, they come in at weights below 4,000 lbs which makes it easy to tow.

                                                <p>
                                                    People who own theses types of trailers are usually very proud and friendly people. They gather at rallies such as TearStock which is hosted in Mackinaw City, 
                                                    Michigan.

                                                    Sports utility rvs are more suited for the most adventurous of all rvers. These rvs are specifically built for someone who wants to take their motorized toys with them on the road. It is equipped with a rear-end that drops down and forms a ramp so that you can get your motorized toys in and out easily. There will always be a wall separating the garage area of the motorhome from the living quarters.

                                               <h4>The Vw Van</h4>


<p>This van has become an icon in so many different car scenes. They can be had for cheap if you look around or keep an eye open on the market. However, if you need one that is in great condition then you might be paying a pretty penny. 
</p>

                                                <img class="lazy" src="img/loadingimg.jpg" data-src="img/oldvan2.jpg" alt="VW van">

<p>This Vw van is the perfect example of how good one of these vans can become. Who would not want a perfectly restored vw van as a recreational vehicle. You have to understand though that these types of recreational vehicles are on the small interior side. They are fun to own, but it would be wise to stay inside one for a few minutes first. Sit in the back and pretend to use your laptop, stand in the back, and pretend to cook on a stove, lay down in a certain area of the vehicle, and pretend to sleep. 
</p>

<p>You do all these things first to see if it would be comfortable for even a night. The aim of renovating one of these is to at least be able to sleep in it for a couple of hours. 
    So try to follow the simple steps above to see how comfortable you would be in one of them.
</p>

<p>
    The next step to take is to try and get the chance to test drive one of these recreational vehicles. I am the type of person who loved driving small sports cars and suvs so getting into driving recreational vehicles was kind of a hard change. It is hard when you are just starting out because the larger the recreational vehicle the more skill is needed to maneuver it. When driving one of these vehicles, you have to remember that you are not in a regular vehicle, almost everything you learned while driving a regular vehicle has to be tweaked a little bit.

    <li class="whatdoesrvmean">You will have to learn to apply your brakes earlier in order to stop.</li>

<h4>Some people convert cars into rvs</h4>

<h5>1. Honda Element</h5>

<img class="lazy" src="img/loadingimg.jpg" data-src="img/hondaelement.jpg" alt="Honda Element">

<p>
You will be surprised to know that you will see a couple of people turning their cars/suvs into recreational vehicles. This idea of using the 
honda element comes from a website called <a href="https://www.doityourselfrv.com/suvs-crossover-campers/">doityourselfrv</a>. This can be a cheap way of getting into the rv scene if you happen to have an extra honda element laying around. It is not the most spacious car/suv available today but they are at a good price range right now to be considered. A 2010 Honda Element with a little over 100,000 Miles is listed at $10,990 at the time of writing this on KellyBlueBook. With that price point, I wouldn't overlook this vehicle.
</p>


<h5>2. Honda Crv</h5>

<img class="lazy" src="img/loadingimg.jpg" data-src="img/honda_crv.jpg" alt="Blue Honda CRV">

<p>
Another suv on the list of cars that can be used as a recreational vehicle is the very reliable honda crv. The back seats in this suv can be easily removed so you can convert the rear into a sleeping quarter. There is enough space in the back for two people to enjoy a great nap while bugs chirp away int the night. This is also a great vehicle to consider for conversion.
</p>

<h4>What Do RVs Come With?</h4>

<p>
    <ul>
        <li>A good quality rv will come with its own bathroom with all the bells and whistles.</li>
        <li>Rvs that have the space will come with a complete kitchen. This will include a microwave, a 
            stove, and maybe a small fridge.
        </li>
        <li>Some Rvs come with a full entertainment package: television, satellite, surround sound system</li>
        <li>Rvs usually come with a bedroom, even tho some will be larger than others 
            depending on the price and size of the said rv.</li>
            <li>Luxurious Rvs will come equipped with a dining room.</li>
    </ul>
 </p>



 <h5>Benefits of living in an rv</h5>

 <p>
     One benefit of living in an rv is that you can save money by boondocking(Dry Camping).  Boondocking is when you park at places like Walmart or a cracker barrel for free instead of staying at a campground or rv resort. This practice must be used with discretion as you will not be allowed to park for days on end at these businesses. 
 </p>


 <p>
     Just imagine feeling like you are always on vacation, this is what living in an rv feels like. You will have the option of deciding where to live at any given point without worrying about getting things packed or hiring a mover. With some rvs, you will feel like you're just at home because they come equipped with all amenities like dining rooms, living rooms, kitchen, bathrooms, sleeping areas, and plenty more to enjoy. 

     Just imagine being able to take your place of residents with you whenever there is the threat of any type of natural disaster in your area. 


 </p>

 <h5>New Rver Tips</h5>
 <ul>
     <li>It's best to get a diesel engine for rvs over 37 feet.</li>
     <li>Plan your route and stops when going on long journeys.</li>
     <li>If you have problems reversing, practice in an empty parking lot.</li>
     <li>High Beams do not help in a fog.</li>
     <li>Use a polarity tester before hooking up your rv to outside power supplies.</li>
     <li>Know the level of your fuel at all times.</li>
     <li>Get an aerodynamic rv to save on fuel.</li>
     <li>Know the height and size of your rv to know where is safe to travel at all times.</li>
     <li>Clean every aspect of your rv before and after using it.</li>
     <li>Practice hitching and unhitching before leaving home.</li>
     <li>Get a good size patio mat for when you're at a campground or rv resort.</li>
     <li>Do not overload your rv.</li>
 </ul>

 <h2>Why not to buy an rv</h2>

 <p>
     I know that many of us dream of owning an rv at some point in our life to go on the road and enjoy many adventures. But sometimes we don't think about the negatives that come along with owning one of the vehicles. There are individuals out there that are scared of driving large vehicles or even scared of driving large vehicles. If you are that type of person, then an rv is not for you. Then there is the cost of purchasing an rv that fits all 
     your needs and the insurance cost that comes along with it. Insurance companies tend to charge more for rvs than other vehicles as it is seen to cause more risk to the insurance company because many rvs have thinks like a kitchen and a bathroom. Some rvs are just simply houses on wheels. The maintenance cost can get costly depending on what your rv is fitted with. You need to keep your rv in tip-top shape as you do not want to be inconvenienced with parts not working after driving 500 miles to a campground.
 </p>
 <p>
     If you do not live in your rv full-time then you will need somewhere to store it. Storage facilities can be expensive depending on the size rv you have. Prices usually range from $100 to $200 if you are storing it outside and anywhere from $250 to $400 to store indoors.
 </p>

<h5>RV Model Number Meanings</h5>

<p>
    Rvs have model numbers and there are meanings to these numbers and letters. Say for instance you see a listing for a 2004 Forest River Wildcat WILDCAT 27RK Fifth Wheel. The lettering and numbering will be broken down as being a brand of Forest River, Model WILDKAT 27RK Fifth Wheel which means it has a floor-length of 27 feet and has an RK = Rear Kitchen.

<h2>Average Rv Prices</h2>

<p>
    After reading about all these different classes of rvs, you will definitely be thinking about what are the average costs for each type of rv. For example, most motorhomes will be more expensive than travel trailers as these motorhomes are equipped with their own engine. Also depending on the different types of amenities equipped in your rv will play a major role in the final price of said rv.
</p>

<b>List</b>

<ul>
    <li>Class A: $50,000-$100,000</li>
    <li>Class B: $40,000-$150,000</li>
    <li>Class C: $60,000-$150,000</li>
    <li>Fifth Wheel: $15,000-$50,000</li>
    <li>Travel Trailer: $10,000-$65,000</li>
    <li>Pop-Up Trailer: $8,000-$20,000</li>
    <li>Truck Bed Camper: $3,000-$40,000</li>

</ul>

<p>
    One thing to remember is that these prices are generally just the starting price or starting average cost for each type of rv. These prices will vary depending on the amenities included or if the client requests any type of custom job to be done on the rig. There are class a rvs on the road that cost over 2 million dollars because of all the amenities and custom work that has been done to them.
</p>

<p>
    If you can get a good deal on a used rv in good working order then that might be the route to take. However, if purchasing a used rv, I would suggest purchasing from some type of dealer as you would like to have some type of warranty. Whether it be a 1 year or even 6 months, as you won't necessarily get any type of warranty if you decide to purchase from a regular seller.
