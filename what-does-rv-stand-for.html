</p>

<p>
                                                    <h5>There are many different types of Rv</h5>

<p>
    You can have just about any size RV, the main thing that will hinder us from purchasing the largest and best one. That is the cost, RVs can become very expensive really fast 
    depending on all the features it has and the size. The size will contribute to the high cost as most manufactures set a certain MSRP on all their vehicles based on how many diffrent people can sleep in them at any 
    time. It might be hard to believe, but there are rvs around the world that cost upwards of $3 million dollars and then you have some costing as low as $1000 used. 
</p>

<p>
    The choice is yours as to which rv might fit you or your budget best. Since you are thinking about rv prices then that must mean you are probably going to be in the market for one soon.

                                                    If you have the money and want to make something unique, then it is possible in so amny ways. Many people just take an older van and modify it into becoming a recreational vehicle. 
                                                    This can be a much cheaper way to go as you can buy older vans at a very low cost. 
                                                </p>

                                                <p><b>Below are a couple of vans people regularly modify into recreational vehicles</b></p>

                                                <p>The first one on the list is the Vw Van also known as the Type 2. </p>

                                                <img src="img/oldvan.jpg">


<p>This van has become an icon in so many different car scenes. They can be had for cheap if you look around or keep an eye open on the market. However, if you need one that is in prestine 
    condition then you might be paying a pretty penny. 
</p>


<p><b>The second one on the list is the same Vw Van but this time in prestine condition.</b></p>
                                                <img src="img/oldvan2.jpg">

<p>This Vw van is the perfect example of how good one of these vans can become. Who would not want a perfectly restored vw van as a recreational vehicle. You have to understand though that these types of 
    recreational vehicles are on the small interior side. They are fun to own, but it would be wise to stay inside of one for a few minutes first. Sit in the back and pretend to use your laptop, stand in the 
    back and pretend to cook on a stove, lay down in a certain area of the vehicle and pretend to sleep. 
</p>

<p>You do all these things first to see if it would be comfortable to you for even a night. The aim of renovating one of these is to at least be able to sleep in it for a couple hours. 
    So try to follow the simple steps above to see how comfortable you would be in one of them.
</p>

<p>
    The next step to take is to try and get the chance to test drive one of these recreational vehicles. I am the type of person who loved driving small sports cars and suvs so getting into driving 
    recreational vehicles was kind of a hard change. It is hard when you are just starting out because the larger the rercreational vehicle the more skill is needed to maneuver it. When driving one of these 
    vehicles, you have to rememver that you are not in a regularly vehicle, almost everything you learned while driving a regular vehicle has to be tweaked a little bit.

<h6>Different classes of rvs</h6>
<img src="img/rv-typeslist.jpg">

<p>
    Above you will see a list of all the different types and sizes of Rvs. There are many types to choose from and each type has its own pros and cons.
</p>

<h6>Some people convert cars into rvs</h6>

<h6>1. Honda Element</h6>

<img src="img/hondaelement.jpg">
<img src="img/elementinside.webp">

<p>
You will be surprised to know that you will see a couple people turning their cars/suvs into reacreational vehicles. This idea of usinmg the 
honda element comes from a website called <a href="https://www.doityourselfrv.com/suvs-crossover-campers/">doityourselfrv</a>. This can be a cheap 
way of getting into the rv scene if you happen to have an extra honda element laying around. It is not the most spacious car/suv available today 
but they are at a good price range right now to be considered. A 2010 Honda Element with a little over 100,000 Miles is listed at $10,990 at the time 
of writing this on KellyBlueBook. With that price point, i wouldn't overlook this vehicle.
</p>


<h6>2. Honda Crv</h6>

<img src="img/hondacrvout.jpg">
<img src="img/hondacrv.webp">

<p>
Another suv on the list of cars that can be used as a recreational vehicle is the very reliable honda crv. The back seats in this suv can be 
easily removed so you can convert the rear into a sleeping quarter. There is enough space in the back for two people to enjoy a great nap 
while bugs chirp away int the night. This is also a great vehicle to consider for conversion.
</p>

<h6>What Do RVs Come With?</h6>

<p>
    <ul>
        <li>A good quality rv will come with its own bathroom with all the bells and whistles.</li>
        <li>Rvs that have the space will come with a complete kitchen. This will include a microwave, a 
            stove, and maybe a small fridge.
        </li>
        <li>Some Rvs come with a full entertainment package: television, satellite, surround sound system</li>
        <li>Rvs usually come with a bedroom, even tho some will be larger than others 
            depending on the price and size of the said rv.</li>
            <li>Luxurious Rvs will come equipped with a dining room.</li>
    </ul>
