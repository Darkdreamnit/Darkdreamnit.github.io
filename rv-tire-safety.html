                                                <h2>Why you should always inspect your rv's tires?</h2>
                                                <p>
                                                    Inspecting your rv's tires should be the first thing you do before driving your rv and the  thing you do after you park. Anything can happen while your driving your rv. 
                                                    Your tires could pick up nails or pot holes could damage the sidewalls.
                                                </p>
                                                <h3>How often should you do it?</h3>
                                                <p>
                                                    Every time you start your rv, before you drive off. And when ever you park down for more than 3 days, and then check them at least once a month. If one is picking up any 
                                                    sign of damage or wear on the tire's sidewall, have it replaced immediately.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    The best thing to be is safe rather than sorry. You never want to leave things as important as tires to chance. It's not always the driver's fault or how long a tire has
                                                     been in use that leads to a blowout, sometimes it's the age of the tire.
                                                </p>
                                               
                                                <p>
                                                    The key thing here is to avoid letting your rv tires get old and brittle. If you tow an rv for long distances each year, with heavy loads, you will need to make sure 
                                                    that is not too much wear on the tires. If tire wear is visible, change them.
                                                </p>

                                                <h2>Which tires are best for your rv?</h2>
                                                <p>
                                                    Rv tires are much different than the ones on your personal vehicle. This is because  different types of tires are designed for different kinds of uses. The kind of rv you have will determine your tire choice and this can be a difficult choice to make.
                                                     Luckily there is always good advice available if you seek it out.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    Tires aren't just for looking nice, they are also very important for keeping the vehicle balanced even on poorly constructed roads. Choosing the right tire for your rv is your responsibility. 
                                                </p>
                                                <b>Here are some things you need to ask when buying rv tires:</b>
                                                <ul>

                                                    A radial tire is one that  features a steel belt that wraps around the tire. This was designed to replace bias-ply tires,
                                                     which featured rubber in between layers of cords. The radial style is more durable and lasts far longer than its predecessor.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    In most cases, rv tires are radial because they provide better performance while driving on the road or off-road. They offer greater fuel economy compared to bias tires.
                                                </p>

                                                    Bias tires are  also known as bias-belted tires. These have layers of cords with rubber between them for added strength and protection against deterioration. The design is not very good, so they 
                                                    are slowly being phased out in favor of the radial style tire. These types of tires have a shorter lifespan than radial.

                                                <p>
                                                    To inflate an rv's tire you need to  use either an air compressor and a pressure gauge or nitrogen system inflation.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    Whenever you finish checking rv tire pressure, make sure that the valve cap is tightly secured to prevent air leaks. Check your wheels for any damage or cracks
                                                     before you inflate them. If there are any damages, take it in to get repaired at once because they can cause leakage which will hurt your tires.
                                                </p>

                                                <h4>Using Air Compressor to Inflate</h4>
                                                <p>
                                                    This is the most popular way of inflation most vehicle tires. You first have to  remove the valve cover, see an image for guidance.

                                                    To inflate your rv's tire using an air compressor you need to first choose what type of pressure gauge you should use. The dial and digital gauges are similar
                                                     with only one difference which is the convenience and ease of reading the digital type. The dial type gauge is read by rotating the dial clockwise for higher pressure and counterclockwise for lower pressure. 
                                                    On the other hand, the digital type is easier to read because you can just look at the LCD screen display instead of turning the gauge knob which will be hard if your tire has low or high pressure.

                                                <h4>Using Nitrogen System to Inflate</h4>
                                                <p>
                                                    Using nitrogen to inflate your tires is  more sensible and practical than using air, but is it really beneficial to your tires? Actually, nitrogen has its own advantage which is less oxygen content. This means that the risk of corrosion caused by moisture is reduced. Nitrogen is also known to be less  likely to form bubbles
                                                     inside your tires than air because nitrogen is not affected by temperature or humidity. The cost of using nitrogen over air is more costly because nitrogen will always cost more than air.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    One main disadvantage of using nitrogen is that it can be difficult to find a gas station that sells nitrogen because most stores are equipped with air-inflating filling stations. So if you have rv tires, you will want to make sure that the supply for the nearest gas station is available before traveling long distances.

                                                There are some tips you can follow to avoid blowouts. Before you start driving, always check your tire pressure.
                                                 Check them yourself regularly. If there's something wrong with one of your tires, this will give you enough time to have the problem fixed before it gets worse.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Then, check for tread depth and wear bars on each tire every 300 miles you drive. 
                                                Cars con go much further without having to constantly check tires. However, rvs have more weight to carry around.  Rvs are made to be more durable, but don't abuse them.

                                            <p>
                                                Remember that though it is possible for tires to blow out without any warning signs, there are some things you can watch out for like:

                                                     Be sure to check your tires while they're cold – not straight after driving, or coming from a hot environment like outside in summertime. Tires lose air naturally that way.</li>

                                            <h2>How to store tires properly</h2>
                                            <p>
                                                Storing tires is a big deal. But how do you do it properly?  How do you store tires to last? Let me tell you, 
                                                it is very important that you store the rv tires properly for safety reasons. Storing an unbalanced tire (at least 
                                                it should be if you care about safety) in a garage or anywhere else can lead to damage of your car, house or personal injuries. That's why proper storage measures have to be taken. 
                                                You first must clean the tires of all dirt and grime. Next, wipe the tires down with a clean cloth.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                After cleaning the rv tires, you must store them horizontally (lay your rv tire sideways) and make sure you let both inner faces of the tire
                                                 touch a solid surface. It should also be noted that storing rv tires over time can cause irreversible damage to them. 
                                            </p>
                                            <b>Here are some simple rules to follow when storing tires:</b>
                                            <ol>
                                                <li>Storing rv tires near heat sources can damage them permanently. The best storage area would be in your garage. If you don't have one, then an area that is elevated above the ground and away
                                                     from sunlight and moisture will be suitable for storing rv tires.</li>
                                                <li>It is best to store tires without rims. If that's not possible. Be sure to inflate the tires to 10 Psi.</li>
                                                <li>Place each tire in Polyethylene bags to  prevent them from getting wet. Although tires are not as susceptible to weather conditions such as rain, snow and cold temperatures, storing them outside can affect their performance and durability
                                                     especially if they have been exposed to UV rays, a common cause of tire damage.</li>
                                                <li>If you need to store your rv tires outdoors, be sure they are properly  covered to protect them from weather damage and UV exposure.</li>
                                                <li>If you plan on storing more than one tire,  stack them on top of one another with the valve stems facing upwards and staggered at least two inches apart.</li>
                                                <li>Stacking tires is not recommended if they have been off the rv for more than a couple weeks. The air pressure will dissipate causing cracking, weathering cracks or even separation.</li>
                                       
                                            </ol>

                                            <h2>Maintain correct tire pressure when your tires are cold</h2>
                                            <p>
                                                The best way to maintain the correct tire pressure while your tires are cold is to  utilize a pressure gauge. By maintaining the correct tire pressure, you will be able to keep your tires properly inflated
                                                 and improve gas mileage. What you should always check all four corners of your vehicle and not just one tire you suspect of losing air. 
                                            </p>

                                            <h3>When driving in high altitude</h3>
                                            <p>
                                                You should always check the pressure of your rv tires whenever you have driven to a higher altitude than normal. This is true as altitude affects many different aspects of how vehicles operate.
                                                 The air pressure is also affected and your tires will need to be checked for proper inflation; otherwise, the tires may develop flat spots.
                                            </p>

                                                When it comes to tire safety. You have to make sure that the tires are properly inflated. Check them at least once a week and before every trip. A running engine should be used to check tire pressure. 

When checking your rv tires, make sure that you inflate or deflate them evenly from both sides of the rv tire rim.
