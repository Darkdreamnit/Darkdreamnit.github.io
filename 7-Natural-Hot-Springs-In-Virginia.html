                                                This hot spring is a favorite among many because of the privacy soakers have most of the year. This privacy is given because of the low occupancy this spring gets due to the 
                                                2.5-mile hike to get there. The water temperature here stays at or around 138&deg. You will not have to just enjoy the spring by itself, there are river canyons, waterfalls, and forest scenery to enjoy as well. There 
                                                are a total of seven pools and you will most likely have the option of choosing whichever one you want to soak in.

                                        <p>As stated earlier, hot springs are a great way to relax and also a good source of a mineral bath. Hot springs are used by people of all ages to help with certain types of health conditions. Skin infections and irritations such as eczema and rashes are known to get better or feel better after taking a bath in a sulfur-rich hot spring. Sulfur has many healing capabilities and is known by many around the world to be a good source of help for people with arthritis, dry scalp, and also many other internal disorders such as digestive disorders and menopausal problems.
