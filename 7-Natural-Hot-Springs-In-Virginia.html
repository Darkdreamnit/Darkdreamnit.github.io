                                                The mineral water here contains minerals such as calcium, barium, manganese, silicon, sodium, magnesium, titanium, zinc, and nitrium. Some people say they have tasted the water 
                                                here and it was some of the best tasting water they ever had. Some residents say that the water here is the only water they ever drink and will ever drink.

                                                The Klallam Tribe has used the Olympic Hot Springs for centuries for something they call vision quests. In 1892, Andrew Jacobson was the first European to visit the springs albeit with the 
                                                help of a Klallam friend.

                                                This hot spring is a favorite among many because of the privacy soakers have most of the year. This privacy is given because of the low occupancy this spring gets due to the 
                                                2.5-mile hike to get there. The water temperature here stays at or around 138&deg. You will not have to just enjoy the spring by itself, there are river canyons, waterfalls, and forest scenery to enjoy as well. There 
                                                are a total of seven pools and you will most likely have the option of choosing whichever one you want to soak in.
