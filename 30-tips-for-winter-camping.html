                                                <p>
                                                    Tips for camping in winter is a must have. Camping in winter will never be enjoyable if a plan isn't put in place beforehand. Steps need to be taken in order to not have regrets while you are out in the wild.
                                                </p>
                                                
                                               
                                                <ol>

                                                    <li>Be sure to layer up</li><p>
                                                    
                                                    The first tip i would give for camping in winter is to bring a close-fitting base layer. This base layer is to trap heat close to your body. Polypropylene long johns will be a great option if money is limited on your end. You'll likewise need to have a layer that you can take off and on as you heat up as the days go by. 
                                                    Cotton should be avoided at all costs as it isn't good when the job demands moisture wicking. Cotton will cool your body down fast whenever it gets wet.</p>
                                                               

                                                                <li>Stay as dry as possible</li>
                                                                <p>
                                                                    That brings us to the 2nd winter season outdoor camping tip: Stay completely dry. Water carries out warmth much better than air does, 
                                                                    so Wet garments will promptly decrease your body temperature level. Also, whenever you sweat, your body will cool you down over time. 
                                                                    You can remove layers to restrict sweating. Water-proof boots and also gaiters (together with snowshoes) 
                                                                    are a must-have when you trek through deep snow. If you are going to hike through packed snow, it would be possible to trek with your regular hiking boots that are waterproof treated.
                                                                </p>

                                                                <li>Sleep with your equipment or gear</li>
                                                                <p>
                                                                    If you have any type of damp garments by day's end,  keep them in your sleeping bag. You will benefit from having electronics close to you in your sleeping bag, as electronics in the cold will drastically drain battery life.
                                                                </p>
                                                                <li>Strategic peeing</li>
                                                                <p>Experienced wintertime campers appear to emphasize this as much as possible. Be sure to take in lots of water. 
                                                                    Also, be sure to pee as soon as possible as your body will certainly use up needed calories to heat any kind of pee kept in your bladder.
                                                                     Keep something we call a "Pee Bottle in your tents (unmarked at your very own risk) so you do not need to endeavor right into the cold for a pee at midnight.</p>
                                                                     <li>Be sure to use the right type of sleeping bag</li>
                                                                     <p>
                                                                        First, see if you can use what you have. You can stay clear of spending on a new winter bag by acquiring a sleeping-bag lining, which can expand the temperature level ranking of your resting bag by 10 - 15 degrees. 
                                                                        If the temperature is going to be below the temperature levels of your sleeping bag, it is time to purchase a new sleeping bag that can withstand the expected temperature levels.
                                                                     </p>
                                                                     <li>Store food safely</li>
                                                                     <p>
                                                                        Bears are usually in a deep rest throughout winter, yet there are various other pests that will gladly treat themselves to your food.
