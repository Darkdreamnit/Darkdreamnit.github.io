                                                  Not everyone loves being in a travel trailer that has too much space or even too small of a space. Some 
                                                  people just want to be comfortable while at the same time enjoying their trailer. This is where the 
                                                  2020 InTech RV Intech RV Sol Sol Horizon Base comes in.

                                                <p><b>The Exterior</b></p>
                                                <p>
                                                The length of this camper comes in at exactly 19 feet. The exterior is great, with fibreglass sidewalls and fibreglass 
                                                roof. The front cap is also made with fibreglass and has a tempered glass winshield. One thing i am happy about every single type of vehicle 
                                                is that plain glass was ruled illegal in the manufacturing process which should have been done way sooner than it had been. Enough about that, there is 
                                                a rear entrance door for ease of access. </p>
                                                <p>
                                                You will find the spare under the frame which is a steel wheel and also two storage compartments under the bed. Who can forget anout the rear bullet clearance 
                                                lights and the 2" receiver? Not me. We just talked aboutr the rear entrance door that seems simple, the rv also comes with another entrance to the side 
                                                and that has a screen and a window. You can showoff on your friends with this small camper with ease. The fenders are powder coated black and that makes the rest of 
                                                the camper stand out. </p>

                                                <p>This camper comes in at 3375lbs and it is also equipped with front and rear stabilizer jacks. Getting into the camper is 
                                                    made easy with a simple pullout step.
                                                </p>

                                                   Interior on the 2020 Intech RV Sol Horizon is remarkable. The walls are all grey vinyl and the floor is woven vinyl. 
                                                   There are six windows and they all come equipped with screens(tinted glass). The Dinette window has front roll down shade 
                                                   and the walls are insulated as well as the ceiling. This means that heat will be trapped during the winter and inside will trap 
                                                   cold air during the summer.

                                                    Sometimes we might see something on a brochure saying BTU rating and might not know what this means. BTU stands for British Thermal UNIT, and 
                                                    when it is in regards to campers, it is referring to the amount of energy a fernace or A/C has. This camper is equipped with a 16,000 BTU LP Furnace 
                                                    and a 13,500 BTU Low Profile Roof Mounted A/C. I do not have to mention the fact that this camper is well equipped for anyone to be comfortable.

                                                  next listing here will be for those of us who can afford to spend a couple more thousand dollars.

                                                 This camper is equipped with a rubber roof and metal siding and this is all insulated by fiberglass. It has flush floor main slide room and 
                                                 electric rack and pinion slideout rooms. There is a stow-n-go bunk storage and pass thru storage. The construction is made super sturdy by
                                                 encorperating an I-Beam Chassis.

                                                    There is a double entry step on the lite models and there is a triple entry step on the super slide models. 
                                                    On select models, you will find even find a second entrance. No camper would be complete without a gutter rail 
                                                    and this model comes equipped with one. A gutter rail is needed on every camper just like on every house. The gutter rails 
                                                    protect the sides of the camper from stains that would be caused by water sliding down the sides. The gutter rail directs the woater to a confined area 
                                                    which can be a metal dropoff or pvc grade drop off.
