                                            <h3>Features to consider when buying a portable dog fence</h3>

                                            <b class="list">Types of doors</b>
                                            <p>
                                                Depending on whether or not you have a dog that is small enough for you to raise over the fence, you will need to consider the type of door that the fence has. Maybe it will be a bit too small for you to enter together with your dog. You will need to consider teaching your dog  to use the door before before going on your camping trip. 
                                                You do not want to have to be lifting a large dog over the fence to get them out. Or having to break down the fence with them still inside.
                                            </p>
                                            <b class="list">Type of material used</b>
                                            <p>
                                                The type of material you choose for your fence will play a big role in whether or not you will be a happy camper. You wouldn't want to have a weak material used to build your fence if you have a dog such as a German Shepard or Rottweiler. If you have a dog like a Poodle or a Miniature 
                                                Pincher then the material does not have to be of the strongest type.
                                            </p>

                                            <b class="list">Size of the fence</b>
                                            <p>
                                                Just like how the material used to build your fence is important, the size of the fence is also important. A small fence will not make a large dog happy.
                                            </p>
                                            <h3>Benefits of Using a Portable Dog Fence For Camping</h3>
                                            <p>
                                                Taking your dog outdoors can be a much better option than leaving them with a dog sitter or being left home alone or in a kennel while you are not home. Owning a dog fence will make your trip with your dog more enjoyable, successful, or safe. You can bring all their toys, 
                                                their bowl, and their food containers and keep them all safe and accessible while still providing room to move about in the camping site.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Whether or not you are going to be staying in an rv or tent, a fence will be more enjoyable for your dog.
                                                 A fence will allow your dog to move around while outdoors without having to worry about them getting lost
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                While you are out in the wild, there might be wildlife in the area. These wildlife might be aggressive towards pets. A fence will block your dog from interacting with wildlife.
                                            </p>

                                            

                                        <h6><b>Conclusion</b></h6>

                                        <p>
                                            A dog fence is a great way to keep your dog happy while you enjoy your camping trip. Choosing the right one is always a good start and will avoid the possibility of regretting your 
                                            purchase. Some dog fences are made for small dogs while small are made specifically for medium to large dogs.
