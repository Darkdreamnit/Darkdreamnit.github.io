                                                <h2>What is a fifth wheel?</h2>

                                        <p>
                                            A fifth wheel camper is a type of travel trailer that's mounted to the bed of a truck with special brackets and kingpin hitch in the rear. When not in use,
                                             the trailer folds up out of the way below the cab of the truck. The name "fifth wheel" comes from its 
                                             original use in railroad cars to allow side-to-side motion while rolling down the tracks at high speeds.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            When not in use, a fifth wheel is put into position and sits on top of four small pegs attached to an electric actuator controlled by a 
                                            switch inside your vehicle's cab. With this installed, you can tow long distances without any trouble or risk for damage occurring due to straining your receiver hitch or truck suspension system.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            A fifth wheel is a specialized trailer designed to be towed by a pickup truck. It has two axles
                                             and allows a motorhome or travel trailer to ride much more smoothly behind a pickup truck than
                                              it would if being towed with only a hitch. However, towing requires different driving techniques
                                               than regular trailers so it's important to learn how to tow safely with this
                                             type of setup. Without proper training, you can easily cause accidents while towing a fifth wheel.
                                        </p>
                                        <h2>What is an electric actuator?</h2>
                                        <img src="img/fifthwheel/electric-actuator.JPG" alt="rv electric actuator">
                                        <p>
                                            An electric actuator is a device that makes it possible to control hydraulic cylinders without physically reaching for and turning the cylinder's valve. It essentially transforms your vehicle's electrical 
                                            system into an operating room, making it possible to maneuver cab-mounted fifth wheel trailers with ease as long as you're willing to do some research beforehand.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            A standard way to tow a fifth wheel trailer is by directly attaching it to the truck--which means you cannot detach the trailer from 
                                            your vehicle until you reach its destination. This method adds
                                             extra maintenance costs and shortens your fuel economy. Some states require this type of connection in order for a driver to get his license or registration renewed each year. 
                                        </p>

                                        <h2>What are the Benefits of An Electric Actuator System?</h2>
                                        <p>
                                            These are very beneficial to have if you are towing a fifth wheel camper with your truck. They eliminate the need for a heavy duty winch. 
                                            They provide easier maneuvering of the trailer and they allow you to detach and reattach your fifth wheel much faster than you would without one. 
                                            Electric actuators can be found in a variety of places from custom manufacturing shops to online stores specializing in accessories for trucks with trailers.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            A few things that must be considered is that an electric actuator adds weight to the rear end of your vehicle which could negatively affect the handling.
                                             Also, most manufacturers who sell them suggest using them with equipment other than just a single axle trailer. 
                                        </p>
                                        <h2>How much money does a fifth wheel cost?</h2>
                                        <p>
                                            Fifth wheels usually cost anywhere from $34,999 to $93,000 new. Used ones can be found at a much cheaper price of anywhere around $5,000 to $30,000.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            While there are many things to consider when purchasing a fifth wheel, the cost varies on so many different factors that it can be difficult to identify an accurate price range. 
                                            The biggest factor is most likely going to be the size of fifth wheel you choose which will determine how much space you'll have and what amenities they come with. 
                                            Other factors include whether or not it's used or new, 
                                            if it has been refurbished, and what materials were used in building it. Some of these travel trailers are built using wood, while some are built using aluminum.
                                        </p>

                                        <h2>What about the different types of 5th wheels?</h2>
                                        <p>
                                            When speaking with your dealer about what fifth wheel is right for you, make sure they 
                                             refer to their trailers by brand and style rather than just size because even though two different brands 
                                             may have an 8 foot wide trailer, they can weigh entirely different due to lug spacing, axle lengths and other factors. The most common fifth wheels usually
                                             found in travel trailer applications (because no one has a big enough truck anymore) are 6'0″ "B" and 7'6″ "C". Either one will offer ample room width wise but have their differences. 
                                        </p>

                                        <h2>What is a 6'0" "B" fifth wheel?</h2>
                                        <p>
                                            There are many reasons as to why an owner of a travel trailer or fifth wheel could be interested in adding a
                                             fifth wheel to their rig. A fifth wheel is generally considered overkill for any 3/4 ton regular cab pickup 
                                             truck, but if you're regularly towing 5th wheels or larger then bigger may be better. It is important to understand the features 
                                            and benefits associated with each style fifth wheel so that you can make decisions about which type best suits your needs. Be wise when you choose your new fifth wheel.

                                        <h2>6'0″ "B" vs a 7'6″ "C"?</h2>
                                        <p>
                                            If you're towing anything from a travel trailer to a 5th wheel, then choosing the correct fifth wheel is important. The 7'6″ "C" fits more and 
                                            heavier campers than does the 6'0″ "B." On average a 6'0″ "B" will fit in tight spaces but you'll sacrifice some storage space for additional amenities.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Please don't confuse the terms B and C with right or left hand rotation, both types are available in either direction. ( Right Handed [RHT] means that your steering wheel is on your right side when you
                                             are facing forward ). Although they look similar to one another, they perform different functions and should be thought of as unique fifth wheels.

                                            They can be used for long-term living, as they provide more space and storage 
                                            than most other types of trailers. A fifth wheel costs between $5,000 to $93,000
                                             depending on the size you need and where you purchase it from  or if it is new or used.
